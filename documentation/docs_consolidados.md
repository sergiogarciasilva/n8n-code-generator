# AI Agent node#

An [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself. This agent uses external [tools](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task.

Connect a tool

You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](../../sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.

Agent type

Prior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent had a setting for working as different agent types. This has now been removed and all AI Agent nodes work as a `Tools Agent` which was the recommended and most frequently used setting. If you're working with older versions of the AI Agent in workflows or templates, as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent', they should continue to behave as intended with the updated node.

# Ollama Chat Model node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Chat Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters#

The Ollama Chat Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance#

The Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker#

The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker#

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

    1

|

    docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama

---|---

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker#

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux** , use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

    1

|

    docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers#

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container#

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434#

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies#

Ollama doesn't support custom HTTP agents in its configuration. This makes it difficult to use Ollama behind custom HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Depending on your proxy configuration, it might not work at all, despite setting the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

Refer to [Ollama's FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-use-ollama-behind-a-proxy) for more information.

# Deploy a node#

This section contains details on how to deploy and share your node.

You can choose to:

  * [Submit your node to the community node repository](submit-community-nodes/). This makes it available for everyone to use, and allows you to [install and use it](../../community-nodes/installation/) like any other community node. This is the only way to use custom nodes on cloud.
  * Install the node into your n8n instance as a [private node](install-private-nodes/).

# Query JSON with JMESPath#

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

## The `jmespath()` method#

n8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.

The basic syntax is:

JavaScriptPython

    1

|

    $jmespath(object, searchString)

---|---

    1

|

    _jmespath(object, searchString)

---|---

To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:

    1
    2

|

    var jmespath = require('jmespath');
    jmespath.search(object, searchString);

---|---

Expressions must be single-line

The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.

`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) provide interactive examples.

Search parameter order

The examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/), which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.

## Common tasks#

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.

### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections#

From the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections):

> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
>
>   * List Projections
>   * Slice Projections
>   * Object Projections
>   * Flatten Projections
>   * Filter Projections
>

The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections) for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md "Edit this page")

# Respond to Webhook#

Use the Respond to Webhook node to control the response to incoming webhooks. This node works with the [Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.

Runs once for the first data item

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to Return more than one data item for more information.

## How to use Respond to Webhook#

To use the Respond to Webhook node:

  1. Add a [Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node as the trigger node for the workflow.
  2. In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.
  3. Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.

## Node parameters#

Configure the node behavior using these parameters.

### Respond With#

Choose what data to send in the webhook response.

  * **All Incoming Items** : Respond with all the JSON items from the input.
  * **Binary File** : Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.
  * **First Incoming Item** : Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
  * **JSON** : Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.
  * **JWT Token** : Respond with a JSON Web Token (JWT).
  * **No Data** : No response payload.
  * **Redirect** : Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.
  * **Text** : Respond with text set in **Response Body**.

## Node options#

Select **Add Option** to view and set the options.

  * **Response Code** : Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use.
  * **Response Headers** : Define the response headers to send.
  * **Put Response in Field** : Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.

[Browse Respond to Webhook integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/respond-to-webhook/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Workflow behavior#

When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:

  * The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
  * The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
  * A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
  * A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.

## Output the response sent to the webhook#

By default, the Respond to Webhook node has a single output branch that contains the node's input data.

You can optionally enable a second output branch containing the response sent to the webhook. To enable this secondary output, open the Respond to Webhook node on the canvas and select the **Settings** tab. Activate the **Enable Response Output Branch** option.

The node will now have two outputs:

  * **Input Data** : The original output, passing on the node's input.
  * **Response** : The response object sent to the webhook.

## Return more than one data item (deprecated)#

Deprecated in 1.22.0

n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](../../../../code/expressions/). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.

If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:

  * Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
  * Use the [Aggregate](../n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**.

# flow-logic/execution-order/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/execution-order.md "Edit this page")

# Execution order in multi-branch workflows#

n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:

  * For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
  * For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/).

# integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoftsql/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoftsql.md "Edit this page")

# Microsoft SQL credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Microsoft SQL](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/)

## Prerequisites#

Create a user account on a [Microsoft SQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-is-sql-server) database.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * SQL database connection

## Related resources#

Refer to [Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/connect-to-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=sqldb#connect-to-sql-server) for more information about connecting to the service.

## Using SQL database connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **Server** name
  * The **Database** name
  * Your **User** account/ID
  * Your **Password**
  * The **Port** to use for the connection
  * The **Domain** name
  * Whether to use **TLS**
  * Whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**
  * The **Connect Timeout**
  * The **Request Timeout**
  * The **TDS Version** the connection should use

To set up the database connection:

  1. Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:
     * In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.
     * In the footer of a query window.
     * Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.
     * Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server) for more information. You can also find the information in the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server).
  2. Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the **Database** name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.
     * If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.
  3. Enter your **User** account name or ID.
  4. Enter your **Password**.
  5. For the **Port** :
     * SQL Server defaults to `1433`.
     * If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server) for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.
  6. You only need to enter the **Domain** name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:

         1

|

         SELECT DEFAULT_DOMAIN()[DomainName];

---|---

  7. Select whether to use **TLS**.

  8. Select whether to **Ignore SSL Issues** : If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
  9. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the **Connect Timeout**. Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout) for more information.
     * SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.
  10. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation) for more information.
  11. Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a) for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:
     * **7_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)** : TDS version 7.4.
     * **7_3_B (SQL Server 2008R2)** : TDS version 7.3.B.
     * **7_3_A (SQL Server 2008)** : TDS version 7.3.A.
     * **7_2 (SQL Server 2005)** : TDS version 7.2.
     * **7_1 (SQL Server 2000)** : TDS version 7.1.

# Sub nodes#

Sub nodes attach to root nodes within a group of cluster nodes. They configure the overall functionality of the cluster.

[Cluster nodes](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

# source-control-environments/understand/patterns/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/understand/patterns.md "Edit this page")

# Branch patterns#

The relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Multiple instances, multiple branches#

This pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.

The advantages of this pattern are:

  * An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
  * It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

![Diagram](../../../_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)

## Multiple instances, one branch#

Use this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.

This pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

  * If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](../../create-environments/#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
  * Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

![Diagram](../../../_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)

## One instance, multiple branches#

The instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a Multiple instances, multiple branches pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.

This is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.

No cleanup

n8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.

![Diagram](../../../_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-multi.png)

## One instance, one branch#

This is the simplest pattern.

# integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.supabase/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.supabase/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Supabase node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Supabase node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Filtering rows by metadata#

To filter rows by [Supabase metadata](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata), set the **Select Type** to **String**.

From there, you can construct a query in the **Filters (String)** parameter to filter the metadata using the [Supabase metadata query language](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata#metadata-query-language), inspired by the [MongoDB selectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) format. Access the metadata properties using the [Postgres `->>` arrow JSON operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING) like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):

    1

|

    metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}

---|---

For example to access an `age` property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the **Filters (String)** field:

    1

|

    metadata->>age=gte.21

---|---

You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.

## Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker#

When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Supabase is in Docker#

If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](../../../credentials/supabase/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers#

If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](../../../credentials/supabase/), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`.

## Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase#

If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the [Postgres](../../n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policy.

Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public `anon` key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.

To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the `anon` role, [create a policy](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#creating-policies) to enable the access patterns you intend to use.

# integrations/custom-operations/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/custom-operations.md "Edit this page")

# Custom API operations#

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](../../glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

  * Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](../builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
  * Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

## Predefined credential types#

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types#

To use a predefined credential type:

  1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
  2. In **Authentication** , select **Predefined Credential Type**.
  3. In **Credential Type** , select the API you want to use.
  4. In **Credential for`<API name>`**, you can:
     1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
     2. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

### Credential scopes#

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in Using predefined credential types, and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

![The scopes box](../../_images/integrations/custom-operations/scopes.png)

## What to do if your operation isn't supported#

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
  2. Select the service you want to connect to.
  3. Select your credential.

# data/transforming-data/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/transforming-data.md "Edit this page")

# Transforming data#

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](../data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

![HTTP Request node output](../../_images/data/transforming-data/HTTPRequest_output.png)

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:

  * [Aggregate](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
  * [Limit](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.limit/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
  * [Remove Duplicates](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
  * [Sort](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
  * [Split Out](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
  * [Summarize](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

  5. Copy the **Access token** and add it to n8n as the **Access Token**.
  6. Copy the **WhatsApp Business Account ID** and add it to n8n as the **Business Account ID**.

Refer to [Test Business Messaging on WhatsApp](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/become-a-tech-provider-legacy-flow#step-4--test-business-messaging-on-whatsapp) for more information on the above steps.

Fully verifying and launching your app will take further configuration. Refer to Meta's [Get Started for Tech Providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/become-a-tech-provider-legacy-flow#step-5--scale-your-solution) Steps 5 and beyond for more information. Refer to [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review) for more information on the Meta App Review process.

## Using OAuth2#

You need WhatsApp OAuth2 credentials to use the [WhatsApp Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger/) node.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**

To retrieve these items, follow these steps:

  1. Visit the [Meta for Developers Apps dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
  2. Select your Meta app.
  3. In the left-side menu, select **App settings** > **Basic**.
  4. Copy the **App ID** and enter it as the **Client ID** within the n8n credential.
  5. Copy the **App Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** within the n8n credential.

Fully verifying and launching your app will take further configuration. Refer to Meta's [Get Started for Tech Providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/become-a-tech-provider-legacy-flow#step-5--scale-your-solution) Steps 5 and beyond for more information.

# workflows/history/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/history.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow history#

Feature availability

  * Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
  * Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
  * Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

## Understand workflow history#

n8n creates a new version when you:

  * Save your workflow.
  * Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
  * Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](../../source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](../executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history#

To view a workflow's history:

  1. Open the workflow.
  2. Select **Workflow history** ![Workflow history icon](../../_images/common-icons/workflow-history.png). n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions#

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

  1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** ![Options icon](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png).
  2. Choose what you want to do:
     * **Restore this version** : replace your current workflow with the selected version.
     * **Clone to new workflow** : create a new workflow based on the selected version.
     * **Open version in new tab** : open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
     * **Download** : download the version as JSON.

# flow-logic/waiting/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/waiting.md "Edit this page")

# Waiting#

Waiting allows you to pause a workflow mid-execution, then resume where the workflow left off, with the same data. This is useful if you need to rate limit your calls to a service, or wait for an external event to complete. You can wait for a specified duration, or until a webhook fires.

Making a workflow wait uses the [Wait](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node. Refer to the node documentation for usage details.

n8n provides a workflow template with a basic example of [Rate limiting and waiting for external events](https://n8n.io/workflows/1749-rate-limiting-and-waiting-for-external-events/).

# OpenAI node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [OpenAI node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you#

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

  1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

  2. Use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota#

Quota issues

There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

  * Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
  * Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
  * Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
  * Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
  * Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
  * Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

In n8n:

  * check that the [OpenAI credentials](../../../credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
  * ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](../) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](../../../credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters#

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

## Referenced node is unexecuted#

This error displays when a previous node in the workflow hasn't executed and isn't providing output that this node needs as input.

The full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

    1

|

    An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.

---|---

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that call JavaScript or other custom code, determine if a node has executed before trying to use the value by calling:

    1

|

    $("<node-name>").isExecuted

# Output of other nodes#

Methods for working with the output of other nodes. Some methods and variables aren't available in the Code node.

Python support

You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.

JavaScriptPython

Method | Description | Available in Code node?
---|---|---
`$("<node-name>").all(branchIndex?, runIndex?)` | Returns all items from a given node. If `branchIndex` isn't given it will default to the output that connects `node-name` with the node where you use the expression or code. | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)
`$("<node-name>").first(branchIndex?, runIndex?)` | The first item output by the given node.

# Facebook Trigger Instagram object#

Use this object to receive updates when someone comments on the Media objects of your app users; @mentions your app users; or when Stories of your app users expire. Refer to [Facebook Trigger](../) for more information on the trigger itself.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

## Trigger configuration#

To configure the trigger with this Object:

  1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
  2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
  3. Select **Instagram** as the **Object**.
  4. **Field Names or IDs** : By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
     * **Comments** : Notifies you when anyone comments on an IG Media owned by your app's Instagram user.
     * **Messaging Handover**
     * **Mentions** : Notifies you whenever an Instagram user @mentions an Instagram Business or Creator Account in a comment or caption.
     * **Messages** : Notifies you when anyone messages your app's Instagram user.
     * **Messaging Seen** : Notifies you when someone sees a message sent by your app's Instagram user.
     * **Standby**
     * **Story Insights** : Notifies you one hour after a story expires with metrics describing interactions on a story.
  5. In **Options** , turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.

# Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node#

Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.

n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:

  * Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
  * Break large workflows into smaller components.

## Usage#

This node runs in response to a call from the [Execute Sub-workflow](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) nodes.

### Create the sub-workflow#

  1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

  2. **Optional** : configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

     1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](../../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
     2. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
  3. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).
  4. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
     * **Define using fields below** : Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
     * **Define using JSON example** : Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
     * **Accept all data** : Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
  5. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
  6. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

  1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
  2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
  3. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
  4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
  5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/).
  6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow#

  1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
  2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.
  3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

  4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

  5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## Templates and examples#

[Browse Execute Sub-workflow Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/execute-workflow-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## How data passes between workflows#

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B** :

  1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
  2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

## Waiting for a response#

By choosing the **Send and Wait for a Response** operation, you can send a message and pause the workflow execution until a person confirms the action or provides more information.

### Response Type#

You can choose between the following types of waiting and approval actions:

  * **Approval** : Users can approve or disapprove from within the message.
  * **Free Text** : Users can submit a response with a form.
  * **Custom Form** : Users can submit a response with a custom form.

You can customize the waiting and response behavior depending on which response type you choose. You can configure these options in any of the above response types:

  * **Limit Wait Time** : Whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.
  * **Append n8n Attribution** : Whether to mention in the message that it was sent automatically with n8n (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Approval response customization#

When using the Approval response type, you can choose whether to present only an approval button or both approval _and_ disapproval buttons.

You can also customize the button labels for the buttons you include.

### Free Text response customization#

When using the Free Text response type, you can customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.

### Custom Form response customization#

When using the Custom Form response type, you build a form using the fields and options you want.

You can customize each form element with the settings outlined in the [n8n Form trigger's form elements](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/#form-elements). To add more fields, select the **Add Form Element** button.

You'll also be able to customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.

# Demonstration of key differences between agents and chains#

In this workflow you can choose whether your chat query goes to an [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) or [chain](../../../glossary/#ai-chain). It shows some of the ways that agents are more powerful than chains.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/agents_vs_chains.json)

## Key features#

This workflow uses:

  * [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
  * [Switch node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/): directs your query to either the agent or chain, depending on which you specify in your query. If you say "agent" it sends it to the agent. If you say "chain" it sends it to the chain.
  * [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the Agent node interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool) to use.
  * [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): the Basic LLM Chain node supports chatting with a connected LLM, but doesn't support [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) or tools.

## Using the example#

To load the template into your n8n instance:

  1. Download the workflow JSON file.
  2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
  3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

  * Yellow: notes and information.
  * Green: instructions to run the workflow.
  * Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
  * Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# Binary data environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

By default, n8n uses memory to store binary data. Enterprise users can choose to use an external service instead. Refer to [External storage](../../../scaling/external-storage/) for more information on using external storage for binary data.

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` | String | `filesystem` | A comma separated list of available binary data modes.
`N8N_BINARY_DATA_STORAGE_PATH` | String | `N8N_USER_FOLDER/binaryData` | The path where n8n stores binary data.
`N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` | String | `default` | The default binary data mode. `default` keeps binary data in memory. Set to `filesystem` to use the filesystem, or `s3` to AWS S3. Note that binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# Embeddings Google PaLM node#

Use the Embeddings Google PaLM node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google PaLM node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/googleai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

n8n dynamically loads models from the Google PaLM API and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Templates and examples#

[Browse Embeddings Google PaLM integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-google-palm/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

Refer to [Langchain's Google PaLM embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/text_embedding/google_palm/) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## AI glossary#

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
  * **vector store** : A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

# user-management/ldap/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/ldap.md "Edit this page")

# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)#

Feature availability

  * Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
  * You need access to the n8n instance owner account.

This page tells you how to enable LDAP in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with LDAP, and have an existing LDAP server set up.

LDAP allows users to sign in to n8n with their organization credentials, instead of an n8n login.

## Enable LDAP#

  1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
  2. Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](../../_images/common-icons/settings.png) > **LDAP**.
  3. Toggle on **Enable LDAP Login**.
  4. Complete the fields with details from your LDAP server.
  5. Select **Test connection** to check your connection setup, or **Save connection** to create the connection.

After enabling LDAP, anyone on your LDAP server can sign in to the n8n instance, unless you exclude them using the **User Filter** setting.

You can still create non-LDAP users (email users) on the **Settings** > **Users** page.

## Merging n8n and LDAP accounts#

If n8n finds matching accounts (matching emails) for email users and LDAP users, the user must sign in with their LDAP account. n8n instance owner accounts are excluded from this: n8n never converts owner accounts to LDAP users.

## LDAP user accounts in n8n#

On first sign in, n8n creates a user account in n8n for the LDAP user.

You must manage user details on the LDAP server, not in n8n. If you update or delete a user on your LDAP server, the n8n account updates at the next scheduled sync, or when the user next tries to log in, whichever happens first.

User deletion

If you remove a user from your LDAP server, they lose n8n access on the next sync.

## Turn LDAP off#

To turn LDAP off:

  1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
  2. Select **Settings** ![Settings icon](../../_images/common-icons/settings.png) > **LDAP**.
  3. Toggle off **Enable LDAP Login**.

If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/serp/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node options#

  * **Country** : Enter the country code you'd like to use. Refer to [Google GL Parameter: Supported Google Countries](https://serpapi.com/google-countries) for supported countries and country codes.
  * **Device** : Select the device to use to get the search results.
  * **Explicit Array** : Choose whether to force SerpApi to fetch the Google results even if a cached version is already present (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Google Domain** : Enter the Google Domain to use. Refer to [Supported Google Domains](https://serpapi.com/google-domains) for supported domains.
  * **Language** : Enter the language code you'd like to use. Refer to [Google HL Parameter: Supported Google Languages](https://serpapi.com/google-languages) for supported languages and language codes.

# Execute Command node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Execute Command node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found#

This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the **Command** parameter.

To fix this error, review the following:

  * Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the **Command** parameter.
  * Check that the command is in the `PATH` of the user running n8n.
  * If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your command.
    * If n8n is already running:

          1
          2
          3
          4

|

          # Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
          docker ps | grep n8n
          # Try to execute the command within the running container
          docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>

---|---

    * If n8n isn't running:

          1
          2
          3

|

          # Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
          # Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
          docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>

---|---

## Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded#

This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.

To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure.md "Edit this page")

# Node file structure#

Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.

The file and directory structure of your node depends on:

  * Your node's complexity.
  * Whether you use node versioning.
  * How many nodes you include in the npm package.

## Required files and directories#

Your node must include:

  * A `package.json` file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.
  * A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:
    * This directory must contain the [base file](../node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.
    * n8n recommends including a [codex file](../node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.
    * The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
  * A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](../credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.

## Modular structure#

You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.

A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin) for an example of this.

For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook) as examples.

  * `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
    * Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:
    * An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`)
    * Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.
  * `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.
  * `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.

## Versioning#

If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](../node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.

## Decide how many nodes to include in a package#

There are two possible setups when building a node:

  * One node in one npm package.
  * More than one node in a single npm package.

n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.

## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes#

n8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.

# workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data.md "Edit this page")

# Custom executions data#

You can set custom data on your workflow using the Code node or the [Execution Data node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/). n8n records this with each execution. You can then use this data when filtering the executions list, or fetch it in your workflows using the Code node.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

  * Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
  * Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

Available in version 0.222.0 and above.

## Set and access custom data using the Code node#

This section describes how to set and access data using the Code node. Refer to [Execution Data node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) for information on using the Execution Data node to set data. You can't retrieve custom data using the Execution Data node.

### Set custom executions data#

Set a single piece of extra data:

JavaScriptPython

    1

|

    $execution.customData.set("key", "value");

---|---

    1

|

    _execution.customData.set("key", "value");

---|---

Set all extra data. This overwrites the whole custom data object for this execution:

JavaScriptPython

    1

|

    $execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})

---|---

    1

|

    _execution.customData.setAll({"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})

---|---

There are limitations:

  * They must be strings
  * `key` has a maximum length of 50 characters
  * `value` has a maximum length of 255 characters
  * n8n supports a maximum of 10 items of custom data

### Access the custom data object during execution#

You can retrieve the custom data object, or a specific value in it, during an execution:

JavaScriptPython

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    // Access the current state of the object during the execution
    const customData = $execution.customData.getAll();

    // Access a specific value set during this execution
    const customData = $execution.customData.get("key");

---|---

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    # Access the current state of the object during the execution
    customData = _execution.customData.getAll();

    # Access a specific value set during this execution
    customData = _execution.customData.get("key");

  4. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.

### Forbidden credentials error#

If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.

# source-control-environments/using/push-pull/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/using/push-pull.md "Edit this page")

# Push and pull#

If your n8n instance connects to a Git repository, you need to keep your work in sync with Git.

This document assumes some familiarity with Git concepts and terminology. Refer to [Git and n8n](../../understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Fetch other people's work#

n8n roles control which users can pull (fetch) changes

You must be an instance owner or instance admin to pull changes from git.

To pull work from Git, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](../../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.

View screenshot

![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](../../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](../../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is open

n8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.

When the changes include new variable or credential stubs, n8n notifies you that you need to populate the values for the items before using them.

How deleted resources are handled

When workflows, credentials, variables, and tags are deleted from the repository, your local versions of these resources aren't deleted automatically. Instead, when you pull repository changes, n8n notifies you about any outdated resources and asks if you'd like to delete them.

### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull#

When you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.

If the original owner is a user:

If the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.

If the original owner is a [project](../../../user-management/rbac/):

n8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.

### Pulling may cause brief service interruption#

If you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.

## Send your work to Git#

n8n roles control which users can push changes

You must be an instance owner, instance admin, or project admin to push changes to git.

To push work to Git:

  1. Select **Push** ![Push icon](../../../_images/source-control-environments/push-icon.png) in the main menu.

View screenshot

![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](../../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](../../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is open

  2. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.

  3. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.
  4. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## What gets committed#

n8n commits the following to Git:

  * Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.
  * Credential stubs (ID, name, type)
  * Variable stubs (ID and name)
  * Projects
  * Folders

## Merge behaviors and conflicts#

n8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.

### Workflows#

You have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.

When pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.

When you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.

To prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.

To avoid losing data:

  * Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.
  * Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.
  * Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.

### Credentials, variables and workflow tags#

Credentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.

On pull:

  * If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.
  * If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:
    * You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.
    * The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.
    * The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.

On push:

  * n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.
  * If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.

Manage credentials with an external secrets vault

If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [external secrets](../../../external-secrets/).

# advanced-ai/examples/understand-vector-databases/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/examples/understand-vector-databases.md "Edit this page")

# What are vector databases?#

Vector databases store information as numbers:

> A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db))

This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.

## A simplified example#

A vector database could store the sentence "n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.

Suppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:

Sentence | Vector (array of dimensions)
---|---
n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
Zapier is an automation tool | [0.1]
Make is an automation tool | [0.1]
Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host | [0.3]

This example is very simplified

In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.

## Demonstrating the power of similarity search#

Qdrant provides [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/) to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.

> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))

For full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery).

## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders#

Vector databases require other tools to function:

  * Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for [embedding](../../../glossary/#ai-embedding). Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.
  * Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.
  * Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to Service-specific settings for more guidance on those services.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

  1. Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
  2. Generate a client secret for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

### Register an application#

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

  1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
  2. Select **Register an application**.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
  4. In **Supported account types** , select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
  5. In **Register an application** :
     1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
     2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
     3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
  6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
  7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret#

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

  1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
  2. In **Client secrets** , select **\+ New client secret**.
  3. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
  4. Select **Add**.
  5. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
  6. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
  7. If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to Service-specific settings below for guidance on completing those fields.
  8. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
  9. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

### Service-specific settings#

The following services require extra information for OAuth2:

#### Dynamics#

Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:

  1. Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.
  2. Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.

Refer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions) for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.

#### Microsoft (general)#

The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope** s for this credential.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc) for a list of possible scopes.

#### Outlook#

Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:

  1. Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.
  2. Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.

#### SharePoint#

SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.

To complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`.

## Common issues#

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.

### Need admin approval#

When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.

This message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or "tenant") for that application.

The procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent).

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/expressions/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Expressions common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues related to [expressions](../../../expressions/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The 'JSON Output' in item 0 contains invalid JSON#

This error occurs when you use JSON mode but don't provide a valid JSON object. Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as `The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object`.

To resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:

  * Check the JSON with a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/).
  * Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields.

## Can't get data for expression#

This error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.

Another variation of this may appear as `Referenced node is unexecuted`. In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

> An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:

    1

|

    $("<node-name>").isExecuted

---|---

As an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:

    1
    2
    3

|

    {
      "my_field_1": {{ $input.params }}
    }

---|---

## Invalid syntax#

This error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.

For example, the expression in this JSON includes a trailing period, which results in an invalid syntax error:

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    {
      "my_field_1": "value",
      "my_field_2": {{ $('If').item.json. }}
    }

---|---

To resolve this error, check your [expression syntax](https://www.notion.so/code/expressions/) to make sure they follow the expected format.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/salesforce.md "Edit this page")

# Salesforce credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Salesforce](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/)
  * [Salesforce trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforcetrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * JWT
  * OAuth2

## Related resources#

Refer to [Salesforce's developer documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm) for more information about the service.

## Using JWT#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account and:

  * Your **Environment Type** (Production or Sandbox)
  * A **Client ID** : Generated when you create a connected app.
  * Your Salesforce **Username**
  * A **Private Key** for a self-signed digital certificate

To set things up, first you'll create a private key and certificate, then a connected app:

  1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
  2. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
  3. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
  4. You'll need a private key and certificate issued by a certification authority. Use your own key/cert or use OpenSSL to create a key and a self-signed digital certificate. Refer to the Salesforce [Create a Private Key and Self-Signed Digital Certificate documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_key_and_cert.htm) for instructions on creating your own key and certificate.
  5. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
  6. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
  7. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) documentation for more information.
  8. Check the box to **Enable OAuth Settings**.
  9. For the **Callback URL** , enter `http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`.
  10. Check the box to **Use digital signatures**.
  11. Select **Choose File** and upload the file that contains your digital certificate, such as `server.crt`.
  12. Add these **OAuth scopes** :
     * **Full access (full)**
     * **Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
  13. Select **Save** , then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
  14. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
  15. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
  16. Enter the contents of the private key file in n8n as **Private Key**.
     * Use the multi-line editor in n8n.
     * Enter the private key in standard PEM key format:

           1
           2
           3

|

           -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
           KEY DATA GOES HERE
           -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

---|---

These steps are what's required on the n8n side. Salesforce recommends setting refresh token policies, session policies, and OAuth policies too:

  14. In Salesforce, select **Back to Manage Connected Apps**.
  15. Select **Manage**.
  16. Select **Edit Policies**.
  17. Review the **Refresh Token Policy** field. Salesforce recommends using expire refresh token after 90 days.
  18. In the **Session Policies** section, Salesforce recommends setting **Timeout Value** to 15 minutes.
  19. In the **OAuth Policies** section, select **Admin approved users are pre-authorized for permitted users** for **Permitted Users** , and select **OK**.
  20. Select **Save**.
  21. Select **Manage Profiles** , select the profiles that are pre-authorized to use this connected app, and select **Save**.
  22. Select **Manage Permission Sets** to select the permission sets. Create permission sets if necessary.

Refer to Salesforce's [Create a Connected App in Your Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_connected_app.htm) documentation for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) account.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Cloud and hosted users will need to select your **Environment Type**. Choose between **Production** and **Sandbox**.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a connected app:

  1. In n8n, select the **Environment Type** for your connection. Choose the option that best describes your environment from **Production** or **Sandbox**.
  2. Enter your Salesforce **Username**.
  3. Log in to your org in Salesforce.
  4. From **Setup** in Salesforce, enter `App Manager` in the Quick Find box, then select **App Manager**.
  5. On the App Manager page, select **New Connected App**.
  6. Enter the required **Basic Info** for your connected app, including a **Name** and **Contact Email address**. Refer to Salesforce's [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) documentation for more information.
  7. Check the box to **Enable OAuth Settings**.
  8. For the **Callback URL** , enter `http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`.
  9. Add these **OAuth scopes** :
     * **Full access (full)**
     * **Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
  10. Make sure the following settings are unchecked:
     * **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) Extension for Supported Authorization Flows**
     * **Require Secret for Web Server Flow**
     * **Require Secret for Refresh Token Flow**
  11. Select **Save** , then **Continue**. The **Manage Connected Apps** page should open to the app you just created.
  12. In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, select **Manage Consumer Details**.
  13. Copy the **Consumer Key** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client ID**.
  14. Copy the **Consumer Secret** and add it to your n8n credential as the **Client Secret**.

These steps are what's required on the n8n side. Salesforce recommends setting refresh token policies and session policies, too:

  14. In Salesforce, select **Back to Manage Connected Apps**.
  15. Select **Manage**.
  16. Select **Edit Policies**.
  17. Review the **Refresh Token Policy** field. Salesforce recommends using expire refresh token after 90 days.
  18. In the **Session Policies** section, Salesforce recommends setting **Timeout Value** to 15 minutes.

Refer to Salesforce's [Create a Connected App in Your Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_connected_app.htm) documentation for more information.

# PGVector Vector Store node#

PGVector is an extension of Postgresql. Use this node to interact with the PGVector tables in your Postgresql database. You can insert documents into a vector table, get documents from a vector table, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the PGVector node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/postgres/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the PGVector Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents#

You can use the PGVector Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the PGVector Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the PGVector Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> PGVector Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the PGVector Vector Store node to fetch documents from the PGVector Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> PGVector Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the PGVector Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the PGVector Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the Simple Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Table name** : Enter the name of the table you want to query.
  * **Prompt** : Enter your search query.
  * **Limit** : Enter a number to set how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Table name** : Enter the name of the table you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

  * **Table name** : Enter the name of the table you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Table Name** : Enter the PGVector table to use.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options#

### Collection#

A way to separate datasets in PGVector. This creates a separate table and column to keep track of which collection a vector belongs to.

  * **Use Collection** : Select whether to use a collection (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Collection Name** : Enter the name of the collection you want to use.
  * **Collection Table Name** : Enter the name of the table to store collection information in.

### Column Names#

The following options specify the names of the columns to store the vectors and corresponding information in:

  * **ID Column Name**
  * **Vector Column Name**
  * **Content Column Name**
  * **Metadata Column Name**

### Metadata Filter#

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

# Chat with a Google Sheet using AI#

Use n8n to bring your own data to AI. This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that queries Google Sheets.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/chat_with_google_sheets_docs_version.json)

## Key features#

This workflow uses:

  * [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
  * [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the key piece of the AI workflow. The Agent interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
  * [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): plug in n8n workflows as custom tools. In AI, a tool is an interface the AI can use to interact with the world (in this case, the data provided by your workflow). The AI model uses the tool to access information beyond its built-in dataset.

## Using the example#

To load the template into your n8n instance:

  1. Download the workflow JSON file.
  2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
  3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

  * Yellow: notes and information.
  * Green: instructions to run the workflow.
  * Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
  * Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Common issues and questions#

Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](../) and suggested solutions.

## Listen for multiple HTTP methods#

By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:

  1. Open the node **Settings**.
  2. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.
  3. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.

The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.

## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node#

The [HTTP Request](../../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.

  1. Create a new workflow.
  2. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
  3. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
  4. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.
  5. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
  6. Execute the HTTP Request node.

## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node#

You can use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.

Note

In the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.

Make an HTTP request without any parameters:

    1

|

    curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>

---|---

Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:

    1

|

    curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'

---|---

Make an HTTP request with header parameter:

    1

|

    curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'

---|---

Make an HTTP request to send a file:

    1

|

    curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'

---|---

Replace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.

## Send a response of type string#

By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:

  1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.
  2. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.
  3. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.
  4. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.
  5. Connect an [Edit Fields node](../../n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.
  6. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.
  7. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
  8. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.
  9. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).

When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.

## Test URL versus Production URL#

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.

**URL type** | **How to trigger** | **Listening duration** | **Data shown in editor UI?**
---|---|---|---
Test URL | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)
Production URL | Activate the workflow | Until workflow deactivated | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg)

Refer to [Workflow development](../workflow-development/) for more information.

## IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect#

If you're unable to connect from IP addresses in your IP whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.

If so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.

## Only one webhook per path and method#

n8n only permits registering one webhook for each path and HTTP method combination (for example, a `GET` request for `/my-request`). This avoids ambiguity over which webhook should receive requests.

If you receive a message that the path and method you chose are already in use, you can either:

  * Deactivate the workflow with the conflicting webhook.
  * Change the webhook path and/or method for one of the conflicting webhooks.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Airtable Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/airtable/).

## Events#

  * **New Airtable event**

## Related resources#

n8n provides an app node for Airtable. You can find the node docs [here](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/airtable-trigger/) on n8n's website.

Refer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for details about their API.

## Node parameters#

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Poll Times#

n8n's Airtable node uses polling for check for updates on configured Airtable resources. The **Poll Times** parameter configures the querying frequency:

  * Every Minute
  * Every Hour
  * Every Day
  * Every Week
  * Every Month
  * Every X: Check for updates every given number of minutes or hours.
  * Custom: Customize the polling interval by providing a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

Use the **Add Poll Time** button to add more polling intervals.

### Base#

The [Airtable base](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-bases-overview) you want to check for updates on. You can provide your base's URL or [base ID](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-base-table-and-view-ids-from-urls).

### Table#

The [Airtable table](https://support.airtable.com/docs/tables-overview) within the Airtable base that you want to check for updates on. You can provide the table's URL or [table ID](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-base-table-and-view-ids-from-urls).

### Trigger Field#

A created or last modified field in your table. The Airtable Trigger node uses this to determine what updates occurred since the previous check.

### Download Attachments#

Whether to download attachments from the table. When enabled, the **Download Fields** parameter defines the attachment fields.

### Download Fields#

When you enable the **Download Attachments** toggle, this field defines which table fields to download. Field names are case sensitive. Use a comma to separate multiple field names.

### Additional Fields#

Use the **Add Field** button to add the following parameters:

  * **Fields** : A comma-separated list of fields to include in the output. If you don't specify anything here, the output will contain only the **Trigger Field**.
  * **Formula** : An [Airtable formula](https://support.airtable.com/docs/formula-field-reference) to further filter the results. You can use this to add further constraints to the events that trigger the workflow. Note that formula values aren't taken into account for manual executions, only for production polling.
  * **View ID** : The name or ID of a table view. When defined, only returns records available in the given view.

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning.md "Edit this page")

# Node versioning#

n8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:

  * If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
  * When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

Versioning type restricted by node style

If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.

## Light versioning#

This is available for all node types.

One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature:

  1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version.
  2. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](../../declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:

     1
     2

## Full versioning#

This isn't available for declarative-style nodes.

As an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost).

Full versioning summary:

  * The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.
  * The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.
  * n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names.

# workflows/settings/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/settings.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow settings#

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

To open the settings:

  1. Open your workflow.
  2. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu.
  3. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.

The following settings are available:

  * **Execution order** : choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows. **v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on. **v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.
  * **Error Workflow** : select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [Error workflows](../../flow-logic/error-handling/) for more details.
  * **This workflow can be called by** : choose whether other workflow can call this workflow.
  * **Timezone** : sets the timezone for the workflow to use. The default timezone is EDT (New York). The timezone setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node.
  * **Save failed production executions** : whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.
  * **Save successful production executions** : whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.
  * **Save manual executions** : whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.
  * **Save execution progress** : whether n8n should save execution data for each node. If set to **Save** , the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This might increase latency.
  * **Timeout Workflow** : toggle to enable setting a duration after which n8n should cancel the current workflow execution.
    * **Timeout After** : Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.

# Anthropic Chat Model node#

Use the Anthropic Chat Model node to use Anthropic's Claude family of chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Anthropic Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/anthropic/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from:
    * **Claude**
    * **Claude Instant**

Learn more in the [Anthropic model documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/selecting-a-model).

## Node options#

  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
  * **Top K** : Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
  * **Top P** : Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

# integrations/builtin/node-types/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/node-types.md "Edit this page")

# Built-in integrations#

This section contains the [node](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions#

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

  * Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](../../../_images/common-icons/trigger.png).
  * Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Core nodes#

Core nodes can be actions or [triggers](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n). Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.

## Cluster nodes#

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](../../../_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)

## Credentials#

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n).

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.

To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.

To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](../../../credentials/).

## Community nodes#

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](../../community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), refer to [Creating nodes](../../creating-nodes/overview/) for more information.

# privacy-security/what-you-can-do/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/privacy-security/what-you-can-do.md "Edit this page")

# What you can do#

It's also your responsibility as a customer to ensure you are securing your code and data. This document lists some steps you can take.

## All users#

  * Report security issues and [terms of service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms) violations to security@n8n.io.
  * If more than one person uses your n8n instance, set up [User management](../../user-management/) and follow the [Best practices](../../user-management/best-practices/).
  * Use OAuth to connect integrations whenever possible.

## Self-hosted users#

If you self-host n8n, there are additional steps you can take:

  * Set up a reverse proxy to handle TLS, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.
  * Ensure data is encrypted at rest by using encrypted partitions, or encryption at the hardware level, and ensuring n8n and its database is written to that location.
  * Run a [Security audit](../../hosting/securing/security-audit/).
  * Be aware of the [Risks](../../integrations/community-nodes/risks/) when installing community nodes, or choose to disable them.
  * Make sure users can't import external modules in the Code node. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.
  * Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes) for more information.
  * For maximum privacy, you can [Isolate n8n](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

### GDPR for self-hosted users#

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata.md "Edit this page")

# Execution Data#

Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the **Executions** list.

You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to [Custom executions data](../../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for more information.

Feature availability

Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Operations#

  * Save Execution Data for Search

## Data to Save#

Add a **Saved Field** for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.

## Limitations#

The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:

  * `key`: limited to 50 characters
  * `value`: limited to 512 characters

If either the `key` or `value` exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.

# advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function.md "Edit this page")

# Let AI specify the tool parameters#

When configuring [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connected to the Tools Agent, many parameters can be filled in by the AI model itself. The AI model will use the context from the task and information from other connected tools to fill in the appropriate details.

There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between them.

## Let the model fill in the parameter#

Each appropriate parameter field in the tool's editing dialog has an extra button at the end:

![image showing stars icon to the right of parameter field](../../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-stars.png)

On activating this button, the [AI Agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) will fill in the expression for you, with no need for any further user input. The field itself is filled in with a message indicating that the parameter has been defined automatically by the model.

If you want to define the parameter yourself, click on the 'X' in this box to revert to user-defined values. Note that the 'expression' field will now contain the expression generated by this feature, though you can now edit it further to add extra details as described in the following section.

Warning

Activating this feature will overwrite any manual definition you may have already added.

## Use the `$fromAI()` function#

The `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

Only for tools

The `$fromAI()` function is only available for tools connected to the AI Agent node. The `$fromAI()` function doesn't work with the [Code](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/) tool or with [other non-tool cluster sub-nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/).

To use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:

    1

|

    {{ $fromAI('email') }}

---|---

The `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.

For instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.

### Parameters#

The `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:

Parameter | Type | Required? | Description
---|---|---|---
`key` | string | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg) | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
`description` | string | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg) | A string describing the argument.
`type` | string | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg) | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string).
`defaultValue` | any | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg) | The default value to use for the argument.

### Examples#

As an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:

    1

|

    $fromAI("name", "The commenter's name", "string", "Jane Doe")

---|---

If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:

    1

|

    $fromAI("name")

---|---

To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:

    1

|

    $fromAI("numItemsInStock", "Number of items in stock", "number", 5)

---|---

If you only want to fill in parts of a field with a dynamic value from the model, you can use it in a normal expression as well. For example, if you want the model to fill out the `subject` parameter for an e-mail, but always pre-fix the generated value with the string 'Generated by AI:', you could use the following expression:

    1

|

    Generated by AI: {{ $fromAI("subject") }}

---|---

### Templates#

You can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following [templates](../../../glossary/#template-n8n):

  * [Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text](https://n8n.io/workflows/2462-angie-personal-ai-assistant-with-telegram-voice-and-text/)

# hosting/installation/server-setups/heroku/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/server-setups/heroku.md "Edit this page")

# Hosting n8n on Heroku#

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:

  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.
  * [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres) to host n8n's data storage.
  * A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project#

The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku/tree/main)

This opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.

### Configure environment variables#

Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.

You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:

  * **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY** , which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.
  * **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.

### Deploy n8n#

Select **Deploy app**.

After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.

Heroku and DNS

Refer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns) to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.

## Changing the deployment template#

You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku) and deploying from you fork.

### The Dockerfile#

By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.

### Heroku and exposing ports#

Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.

Docker limitations with Heroku

[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands) for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.

### Configuring Heroku#

The `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:

  * `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.
  * The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# Zep node#

Use the Zep node to use Zep as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Zep node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/zep/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Session ID** : Enter the ID to use to store the memory in the workflow data.

## Templates and examples#

[Browse Zep integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/zep/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Related resources#

Refer to [LangChain's Zep documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/zep_memory) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Single memory instance#

If you add more than one Zep node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## AI glossary#

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
  * **vector store** : A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

# Automating a business workflow#

Remember [our friend Nathan](../../../level-one/chapter-3/)?

**Nathan 🙋:** Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.
**You 👩‍🔧:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?
**Nathan 🙋:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.
**You 👩‍🔧:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!

## Workflow design#

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

  1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
  2. Sort the data and format the dates.
  3. Write binary files.
  4. Send notifications using email and Discord.

n8n provides [core nodes](../../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:

  1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
  2. A workflow that generates the reports.
  3. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.

## Workflow prerequisites#

To build the workflows, you will need the following:

  * An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).
  * A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.
  * A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).

Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.

# Install private nodes#

You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.

## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance#

If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n.

  1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).

Your Dockerfile should look like this:

         1
          2
          3
          4
          5

         FROM node:16-alpine

         ARG N8N_VERSION

         RUN if [ -z "$N8N_VERSION" ] ; then echo "The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!" ; exit 1; fi

         # Update everything and install needed dependencies
         RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec

         # Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root
         USER root

         # Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.
         RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \
         	npm config set python "$(which python3)" && \
         	npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \
         	apk del build-dependencies \
         	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;

         # Install fonts
         RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \
         	update-ms-fonts && \
         	fc-cache -f && \
         	apk del fonts && \
         	find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \
         	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root

         ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu

         WORKDIR /data

         COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
         ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

         EXPOSE 5678/tcp

---|---

  2. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.

  3. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

  4. Build your Docker image:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number.
         # For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
         docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .

---|---

You can now use your node in Docker.

## Install your node in a global n8n instance#

If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.

# HTTP Request node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [HTTP Request node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters#

This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:

  * You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.
  * You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](../#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.

Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.

## The resource you are requesting could not be found#

This error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.

This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.

## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON#

This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.

To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:

  * Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.
  * If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:

        1
         2
         3
         4
         5
         6
         7
         8
         9
        10
        11

|

        {{
            {
            "myjson":
            {
                "name1": "value1",
                "name2": "value2",
                "array1":
                    ["value1","value2"]
            }
            }
        }}

---|---

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials#

This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.

To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:

  * Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
  * Format your generic credential in a different way.
  * Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.

## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you#

This error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](../../../rate-limits/) page.

To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:

### Batching#

Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.
  2. Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.
  3. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.

### Retry on Fail#

Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.

  1. In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.
  2. Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
  3. Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`.

Use the Simple Memory node to [persist](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) chat history in your workflow.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Simple Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

Don't use this node if running n8n in queue mode

If your n8n instance uses [queue mode](../../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/), this node doesn't work in an active production workflow. This is because n8n can't guarantee that every call to Simple Memory will go to the same worker.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

Configure these parameters to configure the node:

  * **Session Key** : Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
  * **Context Window Length** : Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/erpnext/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/erpnext.md "Edit this page")

# ERPNext credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [ERPNext](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create an [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key

## Related resources#

Refer to [ERPNext's documentation](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/introduction) for more information about the service.

Refer to [ERPNext's developer documentation](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/introduction) for more information about working with the framework.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : Generate this from your own ERPNext user account in **Settings > My Settings > API Access**.
  * An **API Secret** : Generated with the API key.
  * Your ERPNext **Environment** :
    * For **Cloud-hosted** :
      * Your ERPNext **Subdomain** : Refer to the FAQs
      * Your **Domain** : Choose between `erpnext.com` and `frappe.cloud`.
    * For **Self-hosted** :
      * The fully qualified **Domain** where you host ERPNext
  * Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues** : When selected, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation is unavailable.

If you are an ERPNext System Manager, you can also generate API keys and secrets for other users. Refer to the [ERPNext Adding Users documentation](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/adding-users) for more information.

## How to find the subdomain of an ERPNext cloud-hosted account#

You can find your ERPNext subdomain by reviewing the address bar of your browser. The string between `https://` and either `.erpnext.com` or `frappe.cloud` is your subdomain.

For example, if the URL in the address bar is `https://n8n.erpnext.com`, the subdomain is `n8n`.

# Compare Datasets#

The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.

## Node parameters#

  1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field** , enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field** , enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
  2. **Optional** : You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.
  3. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences** , select one of the following:
     * **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
     * **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
     * **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.
       * Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.
       * Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
     * **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
  4. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.

## Understand item comparison#

Item comparison is a two stage process:

  1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
  2. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.

## Node options#

Use the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.

### Fields to Skip Comparing#

Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.

For example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match** , n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing** , n8n returns them as matching.

n8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.

If you select **Include First Match Only** , n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.

## Understand the output#

There are four output options:

  * **In A only Branch** : Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
  * **Same Branch** : Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
  * **Different Branch** : Contains data that's different between inputs.
  * **In B only Branch** : Contains data that occurs only in the second output.

# Executions environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists environment variables to configure workflow execution settings.

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`EXECUTIONS_MODE` | Enum string: `regular`, `queue` | `regular` | Whether executions should run directly or using queue.

Refer to [Queue mode](../../../scaling/queue-mode/) for more details.
`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable.
`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX` | Number | `3600` | The maximum execution time (in seconds) that users can set for an individual workflow.
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR` | Enum string: `all`, `none` | `all` | Whether n8n saves execution data on error.
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS` | Enum string: `all`, `none` | `all` | Whether n8n saves execution data on success.
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS` | Boolean | `false` | Whether to save progress for each node executed (true) or not (false).
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to save data of executions when started manually.
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis.
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted.

# Item linking for node creators#

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../../integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10

    13
    14
    15
    16
    17
    18
    19
    20

|

    // Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
    newItem = {
    	"json": { . . . },
    	"pairedItem": {
    		"item": item.pairedItem,
    		// Optional: choose the input to use
    		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
    		"input": 0
    };

    // Or set the index manually
    newItem = {
    		"json": { . . . }
    		"pairedItem": {
    			"item": i,
    			// Optional: choose the input to use
    			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
    			"input": 0
    		},
    };

# AWS Bedrock Chat Model node#

The AWS Bedrock Chat Model node allows you use LLM models utilising AWS Bedrock platform.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the AWS Bedrock Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/aws/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model that generates the completion.

Learn more about available models in the [Amazon Bedrock model documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html).

## Node options#

  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

## Single memory instance#

If you add more than one Xata node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

# MultiQuery Retriever node#

The MultiQuery Retriever node automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MultiQuery Retriever node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node options#

  * **Query Count** : Enter how many different versions of the query to generate.

# hosting/installation/docker/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/docker.md "Edit this page")

# Docker Installation#

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) offers the following advantages:

  * Installs n8n in a clean environment.
  * Easier setup for your preferred database.
  * Can avoid issues due to different operating systems, as Docker provides a consistent system.
  * Can avoid compatibility issues due to differences in operating systems and tools.
  * Makes migrating to new hosts or environments more straightforward.

You can also use n8n in Docker with [Docker Compose](../server-setups/docker-compose/). You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

## Prerequisites#

Before proceeding, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Linux Users

Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. Linux users must install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) individually for your distribution.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Starting n8n#

From your terminal, run:

    1
    2
    3

|

    docker volume create n8n_data

    docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

This command creates a volume to store persistent data, downloads the required n8n image, and starts your container, exposed on port `5678`. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `n8n_data`, to persist your data locally.

Once running, you can access n8n by opening: <http://localhost:5678>

## Using with PostgreSQL#

By default, n8n uses SQLite to save [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgreSQL, configurable using environment variables as detailed below.

When using PostgreSQL, it's still important to persist the data stored in the `/home/node/.n8n` folder. This includes n8n user data and, even more importantly, the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when using the n8n tunnel.

If n8n can't find the `/home/node/.n8n` directory on startup, it automatically creates one. In this case, all existing credentials that n8n saved with a different encryption key will no longer work.

Keep in mind

While persisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory with PostgreSQL is the recommended best practice, it's not explicitly required. You can provide the encryption key by passing the [`N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) when starting your Docker container.

To use n8n with PostgreSQL, execute the following commands, replacing the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets, for example `<POSTGRES_USER>`) with your actual values:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14

|

    docker volume create n8n_data

    docker run -it --rm \
     --name n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
     -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
     -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
     -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \
     -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
     -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \
     -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
     -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

You can find a complete `docker-compose` file for PostgreSQL in the [n8n hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).

## Setting timezone#

To define the timezone n8n should use, you can set the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Schedule-oriented nodes, like the [Schedule Trigger node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) use this to determine the correct timezone.

You can set the system timezone, which controls what some scripts and commands like `date` return, using the `TZ` environment variable.

This example sets the same timezone for both variables:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9

|

    docker volume create n8n_data

    docker run -it --rm \
     --name n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \
     -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \
     -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

## Updating#

To update n8n, in Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:

![Docker Desktop](../../../_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8

|

    # Pull latest (stable) version
    docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

    # Pull specific version
    docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:1.81.0

    # Pull next (unstable) version
    docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next

---|---

After pulling the updated image, stop your n8n container and start it again. You can also use the command line. Replace `<container_id>` in the commands below with the container ID you find in the first command:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    # Find your container ID
    docker ps -a

    # Stop the container with the `<container_id>`
    docker stop <container_id>

    # Remove the container with the `<container_id>`
    docker rm <container_id>

    # Start the container
    docker run --name=<container_name> [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

### Updating Docker Compose#

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    # Navigate to the directory containing your docker compose file
    cd </path/to/your/compose/file/directory>

    # Pull latest version
    docker compose pull

    # Stop and remove older version
    docker compose down

    # Start the container
    docker compose up -d

---|---

## Further reading#

You can find more information about Docker setup in the README file for the [Docker image](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n).

## n8n with tunnel#

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8

|

    docker volume create n8n_data

    docker run -it --rm \
     --name n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \
     start --tunnel

# insights/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/insights.md "Edit this page")

# Insights#

Insights gives instance owners and admins visibility into how workflows perform over time. This feature consists of three parts:

  * **Insights summary banner**: Shows key metrics about your instance from the last 7 days at the top of the overview space.
  * **Insights dashboard**: A more detailed visual breakdown with per-workflow metrics and historical comparisons.
  * **Time saved (Workflow ROI)**: For each workflow, you can set the number of minutes of work that each production execution saves you.

Feature availability

The insights summary banner displays activity from the last 7 days for all plans. The insights dashboard is only available on Pro (with limited date ranges) and Enterprise plans.

## Insights summary banner#

n8n collects several metrics for both the insights summary banner and dashboard. They include:

  * Total production executions (not including sub-workflow executions or manual executions)
  * Total failed production executions
  * Production execution failure rate
  * Time saved (when set on at least one or more active workflows)
  * Run time average (including wait time from any wait nodes)

## Insights dashboard#

Those on the Pro and Enterprise plans can access the **Insights** section from the side navigation. Each metric from the summary banner is also clickable, taking you to the corresponding chart.

The insights dashboard also has a table showing individual insights from each workflow including total production executions, failed production executions, failure rate, time saved, and run time average.

## Insights time periods#

By default, the insights summary banner and dashboard show a rolling 7 day window with a comparison to the previous period to identify increases or decreases for each metric. On the dashboard, paid plans also display data for other date ranges:

  * Pro: 7 and 14 days
  * Enterprise: 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year

## Setting the time saved by a workflow#

For each workflow, you can set the number of minutes of work a workflow saves you each time it runs. You can configure this by navigating to the workflow, selecting the three dots menu in the top right and selecting settings. There you can update the **Estimated time saved** value and save.

This setting helps you calculate how much time automating a process saves over time vs the manual effort to complete the same task or process. Once set, n8n calculates the amount of time the workflow saves you based on the number of production executions and displays it on the summary banner and dashboard.

## Disable or configure insights metrics collection#

If you self-host n8n, you can disable or configure insights and metrics collection using [environment variables](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/insights/).

## Insights FAQs#

### Which executions do n8n use to calculate the values in the insights banner and dashboard?#

n8n insights only collects data from production executions (for example, those from active workflows triggered on a schedule or a webhook) from the main (parent) workflow. This means that it doesn't count manual (test) executions or executions from sub-workflows or error workflows.

### Does n8n use historic execution data when upgrading to a version with insights?#

n8n only starts collecting data for insights once you update to the first supported version (1.89.0). This means it only reports on executions from that point forward and you won't see execution data in insights from prior periods.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/index.md "Edit this page")

# Chat Trigger node#

Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.

You must connect either an agent or chain [root node](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

Workflow execution usage

Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.

Manual Chat trigger

This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.

## Node parameters#

### Make Chat Publicly Available#

Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).

Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.

### Mode#

Choose how users access the chat. Select from:

  * **Hosted Chat** : Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the node options and don't have to do any other setup.
  * **Embedded Chat** : This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.

### Authentication#

Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:

  * **None** : The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
  * **Basic Auth** : The chat uses basic authentication.
    * Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
  * **n8n User Auth** : Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.

### Initial Message(s)#

This parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.

## Node options#

Available options depend on the chat mode.

### Hosted chat options#

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)#

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle#

Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

View screenshot

![Customizable text elements](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/hosted-text-elements.png)

#### Load Previous Session#

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off** , you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

View screenshot

![Connect nodes to memory](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)

#### Response Mode#

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

  * **When Last Node Finishes** : The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
  * **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node** : The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Require Button Click to Start Chat#

Set whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

View screenshot

![New Conversation button](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/new-conversation-button.png)

### Embedded chat options#

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)#

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Load Previous Session#

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off** , you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

![Connect nodes to memory](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/chat-trigger/connect-memory.png)

#### Response Mode#

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

  * **When Last Node Finishes** : The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
  * **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node** : The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

## Set the chat response manually#

You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.

In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.

If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmollama/index.md "Edit this page")

# Ollama Model node#

The Ollama Model node allows you use local Llama 2 models.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Ollama Model node, and links to more resources.

This node lacks tools support, so it won't work with the [AI Agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node. Instead, connect it with the [Basic LLM Chain](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) node.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/ollama/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from:
    * **Llama2**
    * **Llama2 13B**
    * **Llama2 70B**
    * **Llama2 Uncensored**

Refer to the Ollama [Models Library documentation](https://ollama.com/library) for more information about available models.

## Node options#

  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
  * **Top K** : Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
  * **Top P** : Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

### Node types#

This feature uses [Cluster nodes](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/): groups of [root](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/) and [sub](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) nodes that work together.

[Cluster nodes](../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](../_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)

### Workflow templates#

You can browse [workflow templates](../glossary/#template-n8n) in-app or on the n8n website [Workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows/?categories=25,26) page.

Refer to [Templates](../workflows/templates/) for information on accessing templates in-app.

### Chat trigger#

Use the [n8n Chat Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to trigger a workflow based on chat interactions.

### Chatbot widget#

n8n provides a chatbot widget that you can use as a frontend for AI-powered chat workflows. Refer to the [@n8n/chat npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) for usage information.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/discord/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/discord.md "Edit this page")

# Discord credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Discord](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create a [Discord](https://www.discord.com/) account.
  * For Bot and OAuth2 credentials:
    * [Set up your local developer environment](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-0-project-setup).
    * [Create an application and a bot user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app).
  * For webhook credentials, [create a webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Bot
  * OAuth2
  * Webhook

Not sure which method to use? Refer to Choose an authentication method for more guidance.

## Related resources#

Refer to [Discord's Developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for more information about the service.

## Using bot#

Use this method if you want to add the bot to your Discord server using a bot token rather than OAuth2.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Bot Token** : Generated once you create an application with a bot.

To create an application with a bot and generate the **Bot Token** :

  1. If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true).
  2. Enter a **Name** for your app.
  3. Select **Create**.
  4. Select **Bot** from the left menu.
  5. Under **Token** , select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token.
  6. Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.
  7. In **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents**, add any privileged intents you want your bot to have. Refer to [Configuring your bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot) for more information on privileged intents.
     * n8n recommends activating **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD_MEMBERS**.
  8. In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:
     * Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)
     * Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)
     * Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts) documentation for more information about these installation contexts.
  9. In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.
  10. Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) documentation for more information about these and other scopes.
  11. Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) node:
     * Manage Roles
     * Manage Channels
     * Read Messages/View Channels
     * Send Messages
     * Create Public Threads
     * Create Private Threads
     * Send Messages in Threads
     * Send TTS Messages
     * Manage Messages
     * Manage Threads
     * Embed Links
     * Attach Files
     * Read Message History
     * Add Reactions
  12. Add the app to your server or test server:
     1. Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.
     2. Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.
     3. Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.
     4. Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.

These steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app) guide for more information on creating an app, especially:

  * [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials) for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.
  * [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity) for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.

## Using OAuth2#

Use this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**
  * Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**
  * A **Bot Token**

For details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in Using bot above.

Then:

  1. Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.
  2. Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.
  3. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.

## Using webhook#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Webhook URL** : Generated once you create a webhook.

To get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:

  1. Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.
  2. Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.
  3. Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.
  4. Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.
  5. In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.
  6. Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for more information.

## Choose an authentication method#

The simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.

A **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.

**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/builtin/convenience.md "Edit this page")

# Convenience methods#

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in [expressions](../../../glossary/#expression-n8n).

Python support

You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.

JavaScriptPython

Method | Description | Available in Code node?
---|---|---
`$evaluateExpression(expression: string, itemIndex?: number)` | Evaluates a string as an expression. If you don't provide `itemIndex`, n8n uses the data from item 0 in the Code node. | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)
`$ifEmpty(value, defaultValue)` | The `$ifEmpty()` function takes two parameters, tests the first to check if it's empty, then returns either the parameter (if not empty) or the second parameter (if the first is empty). The first parameter is empty if it's:

  * `undefined`
  * `null`
  * An empty string `''`
  * An array where `value.length` returns `false`
  * An object where `Object.keys(value).length` returns `false`

| ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)
`$if()` | The `$if()` function takes three parameters: a condition, the value to return if true, and the value to return if false. | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg)
`$max()` | Returns the highest of the provided numbers. | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg)
`$min()` | Returns the lowest of the provided numbers. | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg)

Method | Description
---|---
`_evaluateExpression(expression: string, itemIndex?: number)` | Evaluates a string as an expression. If you don't provide `itemIndex`, n8n uses the data from item 0 in the Code node.
`_ifEmpty(value, defaultValue)` | The `_ifEmpty()` function takes two parameters, tests the first to check if it's empty, then returns either the parameter (if not empty) or the second parameter (if the first is empty). The first parameter is empty if it's:

  * `undefined`
  * `null`
  * An empty string `''`
  * An array where `value.length` returns `false`

This node doesn't support SSL. If your server requires an SSL connection, use the [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the [n8n API](../../../../api/). The HTTP Request node has options to [provide the SSL certificate](../../credentials/httprequest/#provide-an-ssl-certificate).

# Reranker Cohere#

The Reranker Cohere node allows you to [rerank](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking) the resulting chunks from a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can connect this node to a vector store.

The reranker reorders the list of documents retrieved from a vector store for a given query in order of descending relevance.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Reranker Cohere node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

### Model#

Choose the reranking model to use. You can find out more about the available models in [Cohere's model documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models#rerank).

# HTTP Request Tool node#

Legacy tool version

New instances of the HTTP Request tool node that you add to workflows use the standard [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node as a tool. This page is describes the legacy, standalone HTTP Request tool node.

You can identify which tool version is in your workflow by checking if the node has an **Add option** property when you open the node on the canvas. If that button is present, you're using the new version, not the one described on this page.

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack.md "Edit this page")

# Slack credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Slack](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)
  * [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token:
    * Required for the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node.
    * Works with the [Slack](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) node, but not recommended.
  * OAuth2:
    * Recommended method for the [Slack](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) node.
    * Doesn't work with the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node.

## Related resources#

Refer to [Slack's API documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and:

  * An **Access Token**

To generate an access token, create a Slack app:

  1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
  2. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
  3. Enter an **App Name**.
  4. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
  5. Select **Create App**. The app details open.
  6. In the left menu under **Features** , select **OAuth & Permissions**.
  7. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to Scopes for a list of recommended scopes.
  8. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
  9. Select **Allow**.
  10. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
  11. If you're using this credential for the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/), follow the steps in Slack Trigger configuration to finish setting up your app.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information.

### Slack Trigger configuration#

To use your Slack app with the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node:

  1. Go to **Features** > **Event Subscriptions**.
  2. Turn on the **Enable Events** control.
  3. In n8n, copy the **Webhook URL** and enter it as the **Request URL** in your Slack app.

Request URL

Slack only allows one request URL per app. If you want to test your workflow, you'll need to do one of the following:

     * Test with your **Test URL** first, then change your Slack app to use the **Production URL** once you've verified everything's working
     * Use the **Production URL** with execution logging.

  4. Once verified, select the bot events to subscribe to. Use the **Trigger on** field in n8n to filter these requests.

     * To use an event not in the list, add it as a bot event and select **Any Event** in the n8n node.

Refer to [Quickstart | Configuring the app for event listening](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#listening) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](../../../../hosting/) and need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**

To get both, create a Slack app:

  1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
  2. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
  3. Enter an **App Name**.
  4. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
  5. Select **Create App**. The app details open.
  6. In **Settings > Basic Information**, open the **App Credentials** section.
  7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste these into the corresponding fields in n8n.
  8. In the left menu under **Features** , select **OAuth & Permissions**.
  9. In the **Redirect URLs** section, select **Add New Redirect URL**.
  10. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the new Redirect URL in Slack.
  11. Select **Add**.
  12. Select **Save URLs**.
  13. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to Scopes for a list of scopes.
  14. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
  15. Select **Allow**.
  16. At this point, you should be able to select the OAuth button in your n8n credential to connect.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information. Refer to the Slack [Installing with OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) documentation for more details on the OAuth flow itself.

## Scopes#

Scopes determine what permissions an app has.

  * If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
  * If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section.

Here's the list of scopes the OAuth credential requires, which are a good starting point:

**Scope name** | **Notes**
---|---
`channels:read` |
`channels:write` | Not available as a bot token scope
`chat:write` |
`files:read` |
`files:write` |
`groups:read` |
`im:read` |
`mpim:read` |
`reactions:read` |
`reactions:write` |
`stars:read` | Not available as a bot token scope
`stars:write` | Not available as a bot token scope
`usergroups:read` |
`usergroups:write` |
`users.profile:read` |
`users.profile:write` | Not available as a bot token scope
`users:read` |

## Common issues#

### Token expired#

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

# integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# MySQL node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [MySQL node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Update rows by composite key#

The MySQL node's **Update** operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a **Column to Match On** and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.

You can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.

To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`:

    1

|

    UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;

---|---

## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker#

When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only MySQL is in Docker#

If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:

    1

|

    docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest

---|---

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If only n8n is in Docker#

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux** , use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

    1

|

    docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers#

If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container#

If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](../../../credentials/ollama/) to use `localhost`.

## Decimal numbers returned as strings#

By default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.

To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.

As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](../../../../../code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/twitter/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/twitter.md "Edit this page")

# X (formerly Twitter) credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [X (formerly Twitter)](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twitter/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create an [X developer](https://developer.x.com/en) account.
  * Create a [Twitter app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps) or use the default project and app created when you sign up for the developer portal. Refer to each supported authentication method below for more details on the app's configuration.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * OAuth2

Deprecation warning

n8n used to support an **OAuth** authentication method, which used X's [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version [0.236.0](../../../../release-notes/0-x/#n8n02360).

## Related resources#

Refer to [X's API documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api) for more information about the service. Refer to [X's API authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/overview) for more information about authenticating with the service.

Refer to [Application-only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) for more information about app-only authentication.

## Using OAuth2#

Use this method if you're using n8n version 0.236.0 or later.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

  1. In the Twitter [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard), open your project.
  2. On the project's **Overview** tab, find the **Apps** section and select **Add App**.
  3. Give your app a **Name** and select **Next**.
  4. Go to the **App Settings**.
  5. In the **User authentication settings** , select **Set Up**.
  6. Set the **App permissions**. Choose **Read and write and Direct message** if you want to use all functions of the n8n X node.
  7. In the **Type of app** section, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
  8. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
  9. In your X app, find the **App Info** section and paste that URL in as the **Callback URI / Redirect URL**.
  10. Add a **Website URL**.
  11. Save your changes.
  12. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.

Refer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) for more information on working with this authentication method.

X rate limits

This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to X rate limits below for more information.

## X rate limits#

X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.

Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:

  * If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
  * If you're Using OAuth2, app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.

Refer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth) for more information about these rate limit types.

# MongoDB Chat Memory node#

Use the MongoDB Chat Memory node to use MongoDB as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server for storing chat history.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the MongoDB Chat Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mongodb/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Session Key** : Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
  * **Collection Name** : Enter the name of the collection to store the chat history in. The system will create the collection if it doesn't exist.
  * **Database Name** : Enter the name of the database to store the chat history in. If not provided, the database from credentials will be used.
  * **Context Window Length** : Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

## Related resources#

Refer to [LangChain's MongoDB Chat Message History documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/mongodb) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Single memory instance#

If you add more than one MongoDB Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## AI glossary#

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
  * **vector store** : A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service.md "Edit this page")

# Google: OAuth2 single service#

This document contains instructions for creating a Google credential for a single service. They're also available as a video.

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

  * [Google Calendar](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
  * [Google Contacts](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)
  * [Google Drive](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/)
  * [Google Mail](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)
  * [Google Sheets](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)
  * [Google Sheets Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/)
  * [Google Tasks](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googletasks/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth#

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

  1. Create a Google Cloud Console project.
  2. Enable APIs.
  3. Configure your OAuth consent screen.
  4. Create your Google OAuth client credentials.
  5. Finish your n8n credential.

### Create a Google Cloud Console project#

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

  1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.
  2. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.
  3. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.
  4. Select **Create**.
  5. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

### Enable APIs#

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.  ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
  2. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
  3. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.
  4. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

     * Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
     * Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

Google Drive API required

The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

     * Google Docs
     * Google Sheets
     * Google Slides

Google Vertex AI API

In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

  5. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen#

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.  ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
  2. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
  3. Select **Get started** to begin configuring OAuth consent.
  4. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen.
  5. For the **Audience** , select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types.
  6. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project.
  7. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy and select **Create**.
  8. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.
  9. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain** :
     * If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
     * If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.
  10. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials#

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

  1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
  2. Select **\+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
  3. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
  4. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
  5. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
  6. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential#

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

  1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
  2. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
  3. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
  4. **Save** your new credentials.

## Video#

## Troubleshooting#

### Google hasn't verified this app#

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized#

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External** , consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

# workflows/components/nodes/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/components/nodes.md "Edit this page")

# Nodes#

[Nodes](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) are the key building blocks of a [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n). They perform a range of actions, including:

  * Starting the workflow.
  * Fetching and sending data.
  * Processing and manipulating data.

n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

  * [Built-in integrations](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
  * [Community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
  * [Creating nodes](../../../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.

## Add a node to your workflow#

### Add a node to an empty workflow#

  1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n).
  2. Select the trigger you want to use.

Choose the correct app event

If you select **On App Event** , n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.

For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

![Screenshot of the Asana node operations list, showing the Recommended section at the top of the list](../../../_images/workflows/components/nodes/recommended-trigger.png)

### Add a node to an existing workflow#

Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](../../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions#

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

  * Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](../../../_images/common-icons/trigger.png).
  * Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

## Node controls#

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

  * **Execute step** ![Execute step icon](../../../_images/common-icons/play-node.png): Run the node.
  * **Deactivate** ![Deactivate node icon](../../../_images/common-icons/power-off.png): Deactivate the node.
  * **Delete** ![Delete node icon](../../../_images/common-icons/delete-node.png): Delete the node.
  * **Node context menu** ![Node context menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png): Select node actions. Available actions:
    * Open node
    * Execute step
    * Rename node
    * Deactivate node
    * Pin node
    * Copy node
    * Duplicate node
    * Select all
    * Clear selection
    * Delete node

## Node settings#

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

  * **Request Options** : Select **Add Option** to view and select these options.
    * **Batching** : Control how to batch large numbers of input items.
    * **Ignore SSL Issues** : Download the response even if SSL validation isn't possible.
    * **Proxy** : Use this if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.
    * **Timeout** : Set a timeout for the request in ms.
  * **Always Output Data** : The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
  * **Execute Once** : The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
  * **Retry On Fail** : When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.
  * **On Error** :
    * **Stop Workflow** : Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
    * **Continue** : Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
    * **Continue (using error output)** : Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.

You can document your workflow using node notes:

  * **Notes** : Note to save with the node.
  * **Display note in flow** : If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.

# integrations/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/index.md "Edit this page")

# Integrations#

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

## Built-in nodes#

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

## Community nodes#

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](community-nodes/installation/) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations#

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](../glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

  * Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
  * Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

Refer to [Custom operations](custom-operations/) for more information.

## Generic integrations#

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

## Where to go next#

  * If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](creating-nodes/overview/) section.
  * Check out [Community nodes](community-nodes/usage/) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
  * If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](builtin/core-nodes/), [Actions](builtin/app-nodes/), and [Triggers](builtin/trigger-nodes/).
  * If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](builtin/credentials/) section.

# integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/community-nodes/installation/verified-install.md "Edit this page")

# Install verified community nodes in the n8n app#

Limited to n8n instance owners

Only the n8n instance owner can install and manage verified community nodes. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management. All members of an n8n instance can use already installed community nodes in their workflows.

Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.

## Install a community node#

To install a [verified community node](../../../creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n):

  1. Go to the **Canvas** and open the **nodes panel** (either by selecting '+' or pressing `Tab`).
  2. **Search** for the node that you're looking for. If there is a matching verified community node, you will see a **More from the community** section at the bottom of the nodes panel.
  3. Select the node you want to install. This takes you to a detailed view of the node, showing all the supported actions.
  4. Select **install**. This will install the node for your instance and enable all members to use it in their workflows.
  5. You can now add the node to your workflows.

Enable installation of verified community nodes

Some users may not want to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel of their instances. On n8n cloud, instance owners can toggle this in the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/). Self-hosted users can use [environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) to control the availability of this feature.

## Uninstall a community node#

# try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow.md "Edit this page")

# Your first workflow#

This guide will show you how to construct a [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:

  * Create a workflow from scratch.
  * Understand key concepts and skills, including:
    * Starting workflows with trigger nodes
    * Configuring [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n)
    * Processing data
    * Representing logic in an n8n workflow
    * Using [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n)

!["Screenshot of the completed workflow"](../../_images/try-it-out/tutorial-first.png)

This quickstart uses [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/), which is recommended for new users. A free trial is available - if you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://app.n8n.cloud/register) for an account now.

## Step one: Create a new workflow#

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

  * A window with a welcome message and two large buttons: Choose **Start from Scratch** to create a new workflow.
  * The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the **Create Workflow** to create a new workflow.

## Step two: Add a trigger node#

n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:

  * Manually, by selecting **Test Workflow**.
  * Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.

For this tutorial, we'll use the [Schedule trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:

  1. Select **Add first step**.
  2. Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
  3. Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
  4. For **Trigger Interval** , select **Weeks**.
  5. For **Weeks Between Triggers** , enter `1`.
  6. Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays** , select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour** , and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.
  7. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.

## Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials#

The [NASA node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) interacts with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.

Credentials

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

  1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the Schedule Trigger node.
  2. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
  3. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.
  4. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
  5. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:

     1. Select the **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.
     2. Select **Create new credential**. n8n opens the credentials view.
     3. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and fill out the form from the **Generate API Key** link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.
     4. Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.
     5. Select **Save**.
     6. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.
  6. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields** :

     1. Select **Add field**.
     2. Select **Start date**.
     3. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date** , select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button ![Add node icon](../../_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.
     4. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:

            1

|

            {{ $today.minus(7, 'days') }}

---|---

This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.

![image showing the expression above generating a date](../../_images/try-it-out/tutorial-date.png)

Date and time formats in n8n...

n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](../../code/cookbook/luxon/).

  7. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.

  8. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.
  9. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.

## Step four: Add logic with the If node#

n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the [If node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.

Add the If node:

  1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the NASA node.
  2. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
  3. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
  4. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:

     1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.

Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section

If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.

     2. Change the comparison operation to **String > Contains**.

     3. In **Value 2** , enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.
     4. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.

Weeks without large solar flares

In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A** , **B** , **C** , or **M**.

  5. Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.

## Step five: Output data from your workflow#

The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/). Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.

  1. On the If node, select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector labeled **true**.
  2. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
  3. Select **PostBin**.
  4. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.
  5. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/) and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.
  6. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.
  7. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.
  8. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content** , select the **Expression** tab (you will need to mouse-over the **Bin Content** for the tab to appear), then select the expand button ![Add node icon](../../_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.
  9. You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.
  10. Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: `{{$json["classType"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:

         1

|

         There was a solar flare of class {{$json["classType"]}}

---|---

![image showing the expression above generating output](../../_images/try-it-out/tutorial-expression.png)

  11. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.

  12. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.
  13. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:
     1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** ![Node context menu icon](../../_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png) > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.
     2. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.

## Step six: Test the workflow#

  1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
  2. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
  3. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.

Time limit

Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.

## Congratulations#

You now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows/try-it-out/quickstart/tutorial.json)

Along the way you have discovered:

  * How to find the nodes you want and join them together
  * How to use expressions to manipulate data
  * How to create credentials and attach them to nodes
  * How to use logic in your workflows

There are plenty of things you could add to this (perhaps add some more credentials and a node to send you an email of the results), or maybe you have a specific project in mind. Whatever your next steps, the resources linked below should help.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-one/chapter-1.md "Edit this page")

# Navigating the Editor UI#

In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the [Editor UI](../../../glossary/#editor-n8n). We will walk through the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.

n8n version

This course is based on n8n version 1.82.1. In other versions, some user interfaces might look different, but this shouldn't impact the core functionality.

## Getting started#

Begin by setting up n8n.

We recommend starting with [n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register), a hosted solution that doesn't require installation and includes a free trial.

Alternative set up

If n8n Cloud isn't a good option for you, you can [self-host with Docker](../../../hosting/installation/docker/). This is an advanced option recommended only for technical users familiar with hosting services, Docker, and the command line.

For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](../../../choose-n8n/#platforms).

Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select **Overview** and then **Create Workflow** to view the main canvas.

It should look like this:

![Editor UI](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-editor-ui.png)_Editor UI_

## Editor UI settings#

The editor UI is the web interface where you build [workflows](../../../workflows/). You can access all your workflows and [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.

### Left-side panel#

On the left side of the **Editor UI** , there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.

The panel contains the following sections:

  * **Overview** : Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.
  * **Projects** : (Not available on Community edition) Projects group workflows and credentials. You can assign [roles](../../../user-management/rbac/role-types/) to users in a project to control what they can do in a project. A **Personal** project is available by default.
  * **Admin Panel** : n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.
  * **Templates** : A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.
  * **Variables** : Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.
  * **All executions** : Contains information about your workflow executions.
  * **Help** : Contains resources around n8n product and community.
  * **Update** : (When updates are available) Indicator for any recent product updates.
  * **Settings** : Under the ellipsis (`...`) menu by your username. Manage users and access settings for a variety of features.

![Editor UI left-side menu](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-side-panel.png)_Editor UI left-side menu_

### Top bar#

The top bar of the **Editor UI** contains the following information:

  * **Workflow Name** : By default, n8n names a new workflow as "My workflow", but you can edit the name at any time.
  * **\+ Add Tag** : Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.
  * **Inactive/active toggle** : This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.
  * **Share** : You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.
  * **Save** : This button saves the current workflow.
  * **History** : Once you save your workflow, you can view previous versions here.

![Editor UI top bar](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-top-bar.png)_Editor UI top bar_

### Canvas#

The **canvas** is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:

  * Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and tidy up the nodes on screen.
  * A button to **Execute workflow** once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence.
  * A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.
  * A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](../../../workflows/components/sticky-notes/) to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon).
  * A dotted square with the text "Add first step." This is where you add your first node.

![Workflow canvas](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-canvas.png)_Workflow canvas_

Moving the canvas

You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:

  * Select `Ctrl`+`Left Button` on the canvas and move it around.
  * Select `Middle Button` on the canvas and move it around.
  * Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.

Don't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.

## Nodes#

You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.

Node

A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.

Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:

  * **App** or **Action Nodes** add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the [Action nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) for a full list of these nodes.
  * **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/) for a list of trigger nodes.
  * **Core Nodes** can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) for a full list of core nodes.
  * **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to [Cluster nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/) for more information.

Learn more

Refer to [Node types](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.

### Finding nodes#

You can find all available nodes in the **nodes panel** on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:

  * Click the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas.
  * Click the **+** icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).
  * Click the `Tab` key on your keyboard.

![Nodes panel](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-node-menu-drilldown.gif)_Nodes panel_

In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Advanced AI, Actions in an App, Data transformation, Flow, Core, and Human in the loop nodes.

If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.

### Adding nodes#

There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:

  * Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.
  * Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.

### Node buttons#

If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:

  * Execute the node (Play icon)
  * Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)
  * Delete the node (Trash icon)

There will also be an ellipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other [node options](../../../workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls).

Moving a workflow

To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or `Ctrl`+`A`, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.

## Summary#

In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas.

In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far.

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches.md "Edit this page")

# Loop Over Items#

The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data when needed.

The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the **loop** output.

When the node execution completes, it combines all of the processed data and returns it through the **done** output.

## When to use the Loop Over Items node#

By default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the [looping in n8n](../../../../flow-logic/looping/) page.

These links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:

  * [Loop until all items are processed](../../../../flow-logic/looping/#loop-until-all-items-are-processed): describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.
  * [Node exceptions](../../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions): outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.
  * [Avoiding rate limiting](../../rate-limits/): demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services.

## Node parameters#

### Batch Size#

Enter the number of items to return with each call.

## Node options#

### Reset#

If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items.

For example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an [If node](../n8n-nodes-base.if/) to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not.

Include a valid termination condition

For workflows like the example described above, it's critical to include a valid termination condition for the loop. If your termination condition never matches, your workflow execution will get stuck in an infinite loop.

When enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from **Fixed** to **Expression**. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.

### Read RSS feed from two different sources#

This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/) on n8n.io.

The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](../../../../try-it-out/).

The final workflow looks like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/rss-feed-example.json)

Copy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:

  1. Add the manual trigger.
  2. Add the Code node.
  3. Copy this code into the Code node:

         1
          2
          3
          4
          5
          6
          7
          8
          9
         10
         11
         12

|

         return [
         	{
         		json: {
         			url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',
         		}
         	},
         	{
         		json: {
         			url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n',
         		}
         	}
         ];

---|---

  4. Add the Loop Over Items node.
  5. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.
  6. Add the RSS Feed Read node.
  7. Select **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.
  8. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
  9. Select **Test Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data.

### Check that the node has processed all items#

To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["noItemsLeft"]}}`. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.

### Get the current running index of the node#

To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["currentRunIndex"];}}`.

# Google Drive node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Google hasn't verified this app#

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

## Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized#

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External** , consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

## Google Drive OAuth error#

If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.

Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.

If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) environment variables use fully qualified domains.

## Get recent files from Google Drive#

To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.

The process looks like this:

  1. Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.
  2. Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.
  3. Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.
  4. Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.
  5. In the **Options** , set the **Fields** to **All**.
  6. Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.
  7. Choose **Simple** sort type.
  8. Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.
  9. Choose **Descending** sort order.
  10. Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.
  11. Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.
  12. Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.
  13. Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.
  14. In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.
  15. Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/saml/okta.md "Edit this page")

# Okta Workforce Identity SAML setup#

Set up SAML SSO in n8n with Okta.

Workforce Identity and Customer Identity

This guide covers setting up Workforce Identity. This is the original Okta product. Customer Identity is Okta's name for Auth0, which they've acquired.

## Prerequisites#

You need an Okta Workforce Identity account, and the redirect URL and entity ID from n8n's SAML settings.

Okta Workforce may enforce two factor authentication for users, depending on your Okta configuration.

Read the [Set up SAML](../setup/) guide first.

## Setup#

  1. In your Okta admin panel, select **Applications** > **Applications**.
  2. Select **Create App Integration**. Okta opens the app creation modal.
  3. Select **SAML 2.0** , then select **Next**.
  4. On the **General Settings** tab, enter `n8n` as the **App name**.
  5. Select **Next** .
  6. On the **Configure SAML** tab, complete the following **General** fields:
     * **Single sign-on URL** : the **Redirect URL** from n8n.
     * **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** : the **Entity ID** from n8n.
     * **Default RelayState** : leave this empty.
     * **Name ID format** : `EmailAddress`.
     * **Application username** : `Okta username`.
     * **Update application username on** : `Create and update`.
  7. Create **Attribute Statements** :

**Name** | **Name format** | **Value**
---|---|---
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/firstname | URI Reference | user.firstName
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/lastname | URI Reference | user.lastName
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn | URI Reference | user.login
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress | URI Reference | user.email
  8. Select **Next**. Okta may prompt you to complete a marketing form, or may take you directly to your new n8n Okta app.

  9. Assign the n8n app to people:
     1. On the n8n app dashboard in Okta, select **Assignments**.
     2. Select **Assign** > **Assign to People**. Okta displays a modal with a list of available people.
     3. Select **Assign** next to the person you want to add. Okta displays a prompt to confirm the username.
     4. Leave the username as email address. Select **Save and Go Back**.
     5. Select **Done**.
  10. Get the metadata XML: on the **Sign On** tab, copy the Metadata URL. Navigate to it, and copy the XML. Paste this into **Identity Provider Settings** in n8n.
  11. Select **Save settings**.
  12. Select **Test settings**. n8n opens a new tab. If you're not currently logged in, Okta prompts you to sign in. n8n then displays a success message confirming the attributes returned by Okta.

### How to submit a post#

n8n appreciates all contributions. Publishing a tutorial on your own site that supports the community is a great contribution. If you want n8n to highlight your post on the blog, follow these steps:

  1. Email your idea to [marketing@n8n.io](mailto:marketing@n8n.io) with the subject "Blog contribution: [Your Topic]."
  2. Submit your draft:
     * Write your post in a Google Doc following the [style guide](https://www.notion.so/97dc73436a624933b75ddc941a361b70?pvs=21).
     * If your blog post includes example workflows, include the workflow JSON in a separate section at the end.
     * For author credit, provide a second Google Doc with your full name, a short byline, and your image. n8n will use this to create your author page and credit you as the author of the post.
  3. Wait for feedback. We will respond if your draft fits with the blog's strategy and requirements. If you don't hear back within 30 days, it means we won't be moving forward with your blog post.

## Refer a candidate#

Do you know someone who would be a great fit for one of our [open positions](https://n8n.io/careers)? Refer them to us! In return, we'll pay you €1,000 when the referral successfully passes their probationary period.

Here's how this works:

  1. **Search** : Have a look at the description and requirements of each role, and consider if someone you know would be a great fit.
  2. **Referral** : Once you've identified a potential candidate, send an email to [Jobs at n8n](mailto:jobs@n8n.io) with the subject line _Employee referral - [job title]_ and a short description of the person you're referring (and the reason why). Also, tell your referral to apply for the job through our [careers page](https://n8n.io/careers).
  3. **Evaluation** : We'll screen the application and inform you about the next steps of the hiring process.
  4. **Reward** : As soon as your referral has successfully finished the probationary period, we'll reward you for your efforts by transferring the €1,000 to your bank account.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama.md "Edit this page")

# Ollama credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Ollama](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmollama/)
  * [Chat Ollama](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatollama/)
  * [Embeddings Ollama](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsollama/)

## Prerequisites#

Create and run an [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance with one user. Refer to the Ollama [Quick Start](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/README.md#quickstart) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Instance URL

## Related resources#

Refer to [Ollama's API documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Using instance URL#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **Base URL** of your Ollama instance.

The default **Base URL** is `http://localhost:11434`, but if you've set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable, enter that value. If you have issues connecting to a local n8n server, try `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`.

Refer to [How do I configure Ollama server?](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for more information.

### Ollama and self-hosted n8n#

If you're self-hosting n8n on the same machine as Ollama, you may run into issues if they're running in different containers.

For this setup, open a specific port for n8n to communicate with Ollama by setting the `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` variable or adjusting `OLLAMA_HOST` to an address the other container can access.

Refer to Ollama's [How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-allow-additional-web-origins-to-access-ollama) for more information.

# Populate a Pinecone vector database from a website#

Use n8n to scrape a website, load the data into Pinecone, then query it using a chat workflow. This workflow uses the [HTTP node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get website data, extracts the relevant content using the [HTML node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/), then uses the [Pinecone Vector Store node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) to send it to Pinecone.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/populate_a_pinecone_vector_database_from_a_website.json)

## Key features#

This workflow uses:

  * [HTTP node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): fetches website data.
  * [HTML node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/): simplifies the data by extracting the main content from the page.
  * [Pinecone Vector Store node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) and [Embeddings OpenAI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsopenai/): transform the data into vectors and store it in Pinecone.
  * [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and [Question and Answer Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) to query the vector database.

## Using the example#

To load the template into your n8n instance:

  1. Download the workflow JSON file.
  2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
  3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

  * Yellow: notes and information.
  * Green: instructions to run the workflow.
  * Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
  * Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/stripe.md "Edit this page")

# Stripe credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Stripe Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripetrigger/)
  * [Stripe](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripe/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key

## Related resources#

Refer to [Stripe's API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) admin or developer account and:

  * An API **Secret Key**

Before you generate an API key, decide whether to generate it in live mode or test mode. Refer to Test mode and live mode for more information about the two modes.

### Live mode Secret key#

To generate a Secret key in live mode:

  1. Open the [Stripe developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers) and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
  2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Create secret key**.
  3. Enter a **Key name** , like `n8n integration`.
  4. Select **Create**. The new API key displays.
  5. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key) for more information.

### Test mode Secret key#

To use a Secret key in test mode, you must copy the existing one:

  1. Go to your [Stripe test mode developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers) and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).
  2. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Reveal test key** for the **Secret key**.
  3. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key) for more information.

## Test mode and live mode#

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key.

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode aren’t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

n8n credentials for both modes

If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.

## Key prefixes#

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

  * Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
  * Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

Publishable keys

Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.

# integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreqdrant/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreqdrant.md "Edit this page")

# Qdrant Vector Store node#

Use the Qdrant node to interact with your Qdrant collection as a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain) or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Qdrant node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/qdrant/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the Qdrant Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents#

You can use the Qdrant Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Qdrant Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in the first part of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2440-building-rag-chatbot-for-movie-recommendations-with-qdrant-and-open-ai/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the Qdrant Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Qdrant Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Qdrant Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2183-ai-crew-to-automate-fundamental-stock-analysis-qanda-workflow/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Qdrant Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Qdrant Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector store.

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Qdrant collection name** : Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.
  * **Prompt** : Enter the search query.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option** , the Metadata Filter.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Qdrant collection name** : Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option** :

  * **Collection Config** : Enter JSON options for creating a Qdrant collection creation configuration. Refer to the Qdrant [Collections](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/) documentation for more information.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters#

  * **Qdrant Collection** : Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option** , the Metadata Filter.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Qdrant Collection** : Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options#

### Metadata Filter#

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the completion.

## Node options#

  * **Frequency Penalty** : Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.
  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Response Format** : Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.
  * **Presence Penalty** : Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
  * **Timeout** : Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.
  * **Max Retries** : Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.
  * **Top P** : Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

  * [Medium](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.medium/)

Medium API no longer supported

Medium has stopped supporting the Medium API. These credentials still appear within n8n, but you can't configure new integrations using them.

## Prerequisites#

  * Create an account on [Medium](https://www.medium.com/).
  * For OAuth2, request access to credentials by emailing [yourfriends@medium.com](mailto:yourfriends@medium.com).

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token
  * OAuth2

## Related resources#

Refer to [Medium's API documentation](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An API **Access Token** : Generate a token in **Settings >** [**Security and apps**](https://medium.com/me/settings/security) **> Integration tokens**. Use the integration token this generates as your n8n **Access Token**.

Refer to the Medium API [Self-issued access tokens documentation](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#21-self-issued-access-tokens) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**

To generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** , you'll need access to the **Developers** menu. From there, create a new application to generate the Client ID and Secret.

Use these settings for your new application:

  * Select **OAuth 2** as the **Authorization Protocol**
  * Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and use this as the **Callback URL** in Medium.

# Structured Output Parser node#

Use the Structured Output Parser node to return fields based on a JSON Schema.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Structured Output Parser node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Schema Type** : Define the output structure and validation. You have two options to provide the schema:

  1. **Generate from JSON Example** : Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values. n8n treats every field as mandatory when generating schemas from JSON examples.
  2. **Define using JSON Schema** : Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema. Please note that we don't support references (using `$ref`) in JSON schemas.

# credentials/add-edit-credentials/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/credentials/add-edit-credentials.md "Edit this page")

# Create and edit credentials#

Credentials are securely stored authentication information used to connect n8n workflows to external services such as APIs, or databases.

## Create a credential#

  1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](../../_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select credential.
  2. If your n8n instance supports [projects](../../glossary/#project-n8n), you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll create the credential inside your personal space.
  3. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

Or:

  1. Using the ![universal create resource icon](../../_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **Create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific project. Select Credential.
  2. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project.
  3. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](../../integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.

Credentials naming

n8n names new credentials "_node name_ account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

## Expressions in credentials#

You can use [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs:

  1. In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.
  2. When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.
  3. Toggle **Expression** on.
  4. Enter your expression.

### Example workflow#

[View workflow file](/_workflows/credentials/dynamic_credentials_using_expressions.json)

#### Using the example#

To load the template into your n8n instance:

  1. Download the workflow JSON file.
  2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
  3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

  * Yellow: notes and information.
  * Green: instructions to run the workflow.
  * Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
  * Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# Vector Store Question Answer Tool node#

The Vector Store Question Answer node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to summarize results and answer questions based on chunks from a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Vector Store Question Answer node, and links to more resources.

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Vector Store Question Answer Tool integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/vector-store-tool/) page.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

### Description of Data#

Enter a description of the data in the vector store.

### Limit#

The maximum number of results to return.

## How n8n populates the tool description#

n8n uses the node name (select the name to edit) and **Description of Data** parameter to populate the tool description for AI agents using the following format:

> Useful for when you need to answer questions about [node name]. Whenever you need information about [Description of Data], you should ALWAYS use this. Input should be a fully formed question.

Spaces in the node name are converted to underscores in the tool description.

Avoid special characters in node names

Using special characters in the node name will cause errors when the agent runs:

![model errors from special characters](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/toolvectorstore/name-characters-error.png)

Use only alphanumeric characters, spaces, dashes, and underscores in node names.

## Related resources#

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-generic.md "Edit this page")

# Google: OAuth2 generic#

This document contains instructions for creating a generic OAuth2 Google credential for use with [custom operations](../../../../custom-operations/).

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

  * [Google Calendar](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
  * [Google Contacts](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)
  * [Google Drive](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/)
  * [Google Mail](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)
  * [Google Sheets](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)
  * [Google Sheets Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/)
  * [Google Tasks](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googletasks/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up OAuth#

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

  1. Create a Google Cloud Console project.
  2. Enable APIs.
  3. Configure your OAuth consent screen.
  4. Create your Google OAuth client credentials.
  5. Finish your n8n credential.

### Create a Google Cloud Console project#

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

  1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.
  2. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.
  3. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.
  4. Select **Create**.
  5. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

### Enable APIs#

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.  ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
  2. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
  3. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.
  4. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

     * Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
     * Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

Google Drive API required

The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

     * Google Docs
     * Google Sheets
     * Google Slides

Google Vertex AI API

In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

  5. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen#

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.  ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
  2. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
  3. Select **Get started** to begin configuring OAuth consent.
  4. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen.
  5. For the **Audience** , select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types.
  6. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project.
  7. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy and select **Create**.
  8. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.
  9. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain** :
     * If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
     * If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.
  10. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials#

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

  1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
  2. Select **\+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
  3. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
  4. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
  5. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
  6. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential#

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

  1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
  2. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
  3. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to Scopes for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:

         1

|

         https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose

---|---

  4. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
  5. **Save** your new credentials.

## Video#

The following video demonstrates the steps described above:

## Scopes#

Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of scopes for all services.

n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

Supported scopes Service | Available scopes
---|---
Gmail |

  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`

## Troubleshooting#

### Google hasn't verified this app#

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized#

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External** , consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

# Hosting n8n on DigitalOcean#

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a DigitalOcean droplet. It uses:

  * [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Droplet from the internet. Caddy will also automatically create and manage SSL / TLS certificates for your n8n instance.
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Create a Droplet#

  1. [Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) to DigitalOcean.
  2. Select the project to host the Droplet, or [create a new project](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/how-to/create/).
  3. In your project, select **Droplets** from the **Manage** menu.
  4. [Create a new Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/) using the [Docker image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker) available on the **Marketplace** tab.

Droplet resources

When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.

SSH key or Password

DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.

## Log in to your Droplet and create new user#

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) for more information.

You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:

  1. Log in as root.
  2. Create a new user:

         1

|

         adduser <username>

---|---

  3. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.
  4. Grant the new user administrative privileges:

         1

|

         usermod -aG sudo <username>

---|---

You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.
  5. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended).
  6. Log out of the droplet.
  7. Log in using SSH as the new user.

## Clone configuration repository#

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

    1

|

    git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git

---|---

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

    1

|

    cd n8n-docker-caddy

---|---

## Default folders and files#

The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

  * `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
  * `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volumes#

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

    1

|

    sudo docker volume create caddy_data

---|---

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

    1

|

    sudo docker volume create n8n_data

---|---

## Set up DNS#

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).

## Open ports#

n8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:

    1
    2

|

    sudo ufw allow 80
    sudo ufw allow 443

---|---

## Configure n8n#

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

    1

|

    nano .env

---|---

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file#

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

  * The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
  * The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

    1

|

    nano docker-compose.yml

---|---

## Configure Caddy#

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

    1

|

    nano caddy_config/Caddyfile

---|---

Change the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
        reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
          flush_interval -1
        }
    }

---|---

If you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    automate.example.com {
        reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
          flush_interval -1
        }
    }

---|---

## Start Docker Compose#

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

    1

|

    sudo docker compose up -d

---|---

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup#

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy#

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

    1

|

    sudo docker compose stop

---|---

## Updating#

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    # Navigate to the directory containing your docker compose file
    cd </path/to/your/compose/file/directory>

    # Pull latest version
    docker compose pull

    # Stop and remove older version
    docker compose down

    # Start the container
    docker compose up -d

---|---

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable.md "Edit this page")

# Airtable credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Airtable](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/)
  * [Airtable Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger/)

## Prerequisites#

Create an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Personal Access Token (PAT)
  * OAuth2

API Key deprecation

n8n used to offer an API key authentication method with Airtable. Airtable [fully deprecated these keys](https://support.airtable.com/v1/docs/airtable-api-deprecation-guidelines) as of February 2024. If you were using an Airtable API credential, replace it with an Airtable Personal Access Token or Airtable OAuth2 credential. n8n recommends using Personal Access Token instead.

## Related resources#

Refer to [Airtable's API documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/authentication) for more information about the service.

## Using personal access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A Personal **Access Token** (PAT)

To create your PAT:

  1. Go to the Airtable Builder Hub [Personal access tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) page.
  2. Select **\+ Create new token**. Airtable opens the **Create personal access token** page.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your token, like `n8n credential`.
  4. Add **Scopes** to your token. Refer to Airtable's [Scopes](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) guide for more information. n8n recommends using these scopes:
     * `data.records:read`
     * `data.records:write`
     * `schema.bases:read`
  5. Select the **Access** for your token. Choose from a single base, multiple bases (even bases from different workspaces), all of the current and future bases in a workspace you own, or all of the bases from any workspace that you own including bases/workspace added in the future.
  6. Select **Create token**.
  7. Airtable opens a modal with your token displayed. Copy this token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.

Refer to Airtable's [Find/create PATs documentation](https://support.airtable.com/v1/docs/creating-personal-access-tokens) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **OAuth Redirect URL**
  * A **Client ID**
  * A **Client Secret**

To generate all this information, register a new Airtable integration:

  1. Open your Airtable Builder Hub [**OAuth integrations**](https://airtable.com/create/oauth) page.
  2. Select the **Register new OAuth integration** button.
  3. Enter a name for your OAuth integration.
  4. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential.
  5. Paste that redirect URL in Airtable as the **OAuth redirect URL**.
  6. Select **Register integration**.
  7. On the following page, copy the **Client ID** from Airtable and paste it into the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.
  8. In Airtable, select **Generate client secret**.
  9. Copy the client secret and paste it into the **Client Secret** in your n8n credential.
  10. Select the following scopes in Airtable:
     * `data.records:read`
     * `data.records:write`
     * `schema.bases:read`
  11. Select **Save changes** in Airtable.
  12. In your n8n credential, select the **Connect my account**. A **Grant access** modal opens.
  13. Follow the instructions and select the base you want to work on (or all bases).
  14. Select **Grant access** to complete the connection.

Refer to the [Airtable Register a new integration documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/oauth-integrations) for steps on registering a new Oauth integration.

# workflows/executions/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/executions/index.md "Edit this page")

# Executions#

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

## Execution modes#

There are two execution modes:

  * Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Test Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
  * Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.

## Execution lists#

n8n provides two execution lists:

  * [Workflow-level executions](single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
  * [All executions](all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](custom-executions-data/).

# advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md "Edit this page")

# What's a tool in AI?#

In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:

> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/))

> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/))

## AI tools in n8n#

n8n provides tool [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that you can connect to your [AI agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent). As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:

  * [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
  * [Custom Code Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.
  * [HTTP Request Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

The next three examples highlight the Call n8n Workflow Tool:

  * [Chat with Google Sheets](../data-google-sheets/)
  * [Call an API to fetch data](../api-workflow-tool/)
  * [Set up a human fallback](../human-fallback/)

You can also learn how to [let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the `$fromAI()` function](../using-the-fromai-function/).

# courses/level-two/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-two/index.md "Edit this page")

# Level two: Introduction#

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 2**!

## Is this course right for me?#

This course is for you if you:

  * Want to automate somewhat complex business processes.
  * Want to dive deeper into n8n after taking the [Level 1 course](../level-one/).

## What will I learn in this course?#

The focus in this course is on working with data. You will learn how to:

  * Use the data structure of n8n correctly.
  * Process different data types (for example, XML, HTML, date, time, and binary data).
  * Merge data from different sources (for example, a database, spreadsheet, or CRM).
  * Use functions and JavaScript code in the [Code node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).
  * Deal with error workflows and workflow errors.

You will learn all this by completing short practical exercises after the theoretical explanations and building a business workflow following instructions.

## What do I need to get started?#

To follow along this course (at a comfortable pace) you will need the following:

  * **n8n set up** : You can use the [self-hosted version](../../hosting/installation/npm/) or [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/).
  * **A user ID** : [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/HQoQ7nXg) to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
  * **Basic n8n skills** : We strongly recommend taking the [Level 1 course](../level-one/) before this one.
  * **Basic JavaScript understanding**

## How long does the course take?#

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?#

There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons:

  * Building the [main workflow](chapter-5/chapter-5.0/)
  * Passing the [quiz](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/r9hDbytg) at the end of the course

You can always **check your progress** throughout the course by entering your unique ID [here](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/course-level-2/verify).

If you successfully complete the milestones above, you will get [**a badge and an avatar**](https://community.n8n.io/badges/105/completed-n8n-course-level-2) in your forum profile. You can then share your profile and course verification ID to showcase your n8n skills to others.

  * **Session ID** : Enter the ID to use to store the memory in the workflow data.

## Node reference#

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Templates and examples#

## Related resources#

Refer to [LangChain's Motorhead documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/motorhead_memory) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Single memory instance#

If you add more than one Motorhead node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

# courses/level-one/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-one/index.md "Edit this page")

# Level one: Introduction#

Welcome to the **n8n Course Level 1**!

## Is this course right for me?#

This course introduces you to the fundamental concepts within n8n and develops your low-code automation expertise.

This course is for you if you:

  * Are starting to use n8n for the first time.
  * Are looking for some extra help creating your first workflow.
  * Want to automate processes in your personal or working life.

This course introduces n8n concepts and demonstrates practical workflow building without assuming any prior familiarity with n8n. If you'd like to get a feel for the basics without as much explanation, consult our [quickstart guide](../../try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow/).

## What will I learn in this course?#

We believe in learning by doing. You can expect some theoretical information about the basic concepts and components of n8n, followed by practice of building workflows step by step.

By the end of this course you will know:

  * How to set up n8n and navigate the Editor UI.
  * How n8n structures data.
  * How to configure different node parameters and add credentials.
  * When and how to use conditional logic in workflows.
  * How to schedule and control workflows.
  * How to import, download, and share workflows with others.

You will build two workflows:

  * A two-node workflow to get articles from Hacker News
  * A seven-node workflow to help your client get records from a data warehouse, filter them, make calculations, and notify team members about the results

## What do I need to get started?#

  1. **n8n set up** : You can use [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/) (or the [self-hosted version](../../hosting/installation/docker/) if you have experience hosting services).
  2. **A course user ID** : [Sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI) to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course.
  3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and [APIs](https://blog.n8n.io/what-are-apis-how-to-use-them-with-no-code/) would be helpful, but isn't necessary.
  4. An [account on the n8n community forum](https://community.n8n.io/) if you wish to receive a profile badge and avatar upon successful completion.

## How long does the course take?#

Completing the course should take around **two hours**. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready.

## How do I complete the course?#

There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons:

  * Building the [main workflow](chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)
  * Passing the [quiz](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/JMoBXeGA) at the end of the course

Check your progress

You can always **check your progress** throughout the course by entering your unique ID [here](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/course-level-1/verify).

If you complete the milestones above, you will get [**a badge and an avatar**](https://community.n8n.io/badges/104/completed-n8n-course-level-1) in your forum profile. You can then share your profile and course verification ID to showcase your n8n skills to others.

# hosting/scaling/execution-data/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/execution-data.md "Edit this page")

# Execution data#

Depending on your executions settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid this, n8n recommends that you don't save unnecessary data, and enable pruning of old executions data.

To do this, configure the corresponding [environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/executions/).

## Reduce saved data#

Configuration at workflow level

You can also configure these settings on an individual workflow basis using the [workflow settings](../../../workflows/settings/).

You can select which executions data n8n saves. For example, you can save only executions that result in an `Error`.

          - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=true
          - EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=false

---|---

## Enable data pruning#

You can enable data pruning to automatically delete finished executions after a given time. If you don't set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, 336 hours (14 days) is the default.

You can choose to prune finished executions data before the time set in `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, using `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`. This sets a maximum number of executions to store in the database. Once you reach the limit, n8n starts to delete the oldest execution records. This can help with database performance issues, especially if you use SQLite. The database size can still exceed the limit you set: old executions that haven't finished running don't get deleted, even if they would otherwise be subject to deletion.

          - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168
    	  	- EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000

---|---

SQLite

If you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data. To free up this space configure the `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite) or manually run the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation.

Binary data pruning

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# Embeddings Google Gemini node#

Use the Embeddings Google Gemini node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google Gemini node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/googleai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

Learn more about available models in [Google Gemini's models documentation](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini).

# data/data-editing/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-editing.md "Edit this page")

# Data editing#

n8n allows you to edit [pinned data](../data-pinning/). This means you can check different scenarios without setting up each scenario and sending the relevant data from your external system. It makes it easier to test edge cases.

For development only

Data editing isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Edit output data#

To edit output data:

  1. Run the node to load data.
  2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
  3. Select **Edit** ![Edit data icon](../../_images/data/data-pinning/edit-data.png).
  4. Edit your data.
  5. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.

## Use data from previous executions#

You can copy data from nodes in previous workflow executions:

  1. Open the left menu.
  2. Select **Executions**.
  3. Browse the workflow executions list to find the one with the data you want to copy.
  4. Select **Open Past Execution** ![Open past execution icon](../../_images/data/data-pinning/open-execution.png).
  5. Double click the node whose data you want to copy.
  6. If it's table layout, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
  7. There are two ways to copy the JSON:
  8. Select the JSON you want by highlighting it, like selecting text. Then use `ctrl` \+ `c` to copy it.
  9. Select the JSON you want to copy by clicking on a parameter. Then:
     1. Hover over the JSON. n8n displays the **Copy** ![Copy data icon](../../_images/data/data-pinning/copy-data.png) button.
     2. Select **Copy** ![Copy data icon](../../_images/data/data-pinning/copy-data.png).
     3. You can choose what to copy:
        * **Copy Item Path** and **Copy Parameter Path** gives you expressions that access parts of the JSON.
        * **Copy Value** : copies the entire selected JSON.
  10. Return to the workflow you're working on:
     1. Open the left menu.
     2. Select **Workflows**.
     3. Select **Open**.
     4. Select the workflow you want to open.
  11. Open the node where you want to use the copied data.
  12. If there is no data, run the node to load data.
  13. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
  14. Select **Edit** ![Edit data icon](../../_images/data/data-pinning/edit-data.png).
  15. Paste in the data from the previous execution.
  16. Select **Save**. n8n saves your data changes and pins your data.

# flow-logic/splitting/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/splitting.md "Edit this page")

# Splitting workflows with conditional nodes#

Splitting uses the [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.

Compare these workflows:

!["Diagram representing two workflows. One has three steps and follows a linear process, with a user submitting a bug, and the workflow emailing a support team. The second workflow starts the same way, but then splits depending on whether the user marked the issue as urgent. It then splits again depending on the user's support plan"](../../_images/flow-logic/splitting/single-multi-branch-workflow.png)

This is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.

Refer to the [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) documentation for usage details.

# Pinecone Vector Store node#

Use the Pinecone node to interact with your Pinecone database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Pinecone node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/pinecone/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents#

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Pinecone Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2165-chat-with-pdf-docs-using-ai-quoting-sources/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the Pinecone Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Pinecone Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Pinecone Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Pinecone Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Pinecone Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2705-chat-with-github-api-documentation-rag-powered-chatbot-with-pinecone-and-openai/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector store.

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)** , and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents#

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Pinecone Index** : Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.
  * **Prompt** : Enter your search query.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Pinecone Index** : Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters#

  * **Pinecone Index** : Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Pinecone Index** : Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options#

### Pinecone Namespace#

Another segregation option for how to store your data within the index.

### Metadata Filter#

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

### Clear Namespace#

Available in **Insert Documents** mode. Deletes all data from the namespace before inserting the new data.

# Hugging Face Inference Model node#

Use the Hugging Face Inference Model node to use Hugging Face's models.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Hugging Face Inference Model node, and links to more resources.

This node lacks tools support, so it won't work with the [AI Agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node. Instead, connect it with the [Basic LLM Chain](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) node.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/huggingface/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the completion.

## Node options#

  * **Custom Inference Endpoint** : Enter a custom inference endpoint URL.
  * **Frequency Penalty** : Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.
  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Presence Penalty** : Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
  * **Top K** : Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
  * **Top P** : Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

# Call an API to fetch data#

Use n8n to bring data from any [API](../../../glossary/#api) to your AI. This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that calls the API. The second workflow uses AI functionality to refine the API request based on the user's query.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/let_your_ai_call_an_api.json)

## Key features#

This workflow uses:

  * [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
  * [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the key piece of the AI workflow. The Agent interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
  * [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): plug in n8n workflows as custom tools. In AI, a tool is an interface the AI can use to interact with the world (in this case, the data provided by your workflow). The AI model uses the tool to access information beyond its built-in dataset.
  * A [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) with an [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/) and [Structured Output Parser](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/) to read the user's query and set parameters for the API call based on the user input.

## Using the example#

To load the template into your n8n instance:

  1. Download the workflow JSON file.
  2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
  3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

  * Yellow: notes and information.
  * Green: instructions to run the workflow.
  * Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
  * Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

# code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination.md "Edit this page")

# Pagination in the HTTP Request node#

The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](../../../builtin/http-node-variables/).

Refer to [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

  * Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
  * Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
  * The structure of the data that the API returns.

## Enable pagination#

In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.

## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`#

If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:

  1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.
  2. In **Next URL** , use an [expression](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:

         1

|

         {{ $response.body["next-page"] }}

---|---

## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`#

If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:

  1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
  2. Set **Type** to **Query**.
  3. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.
  4. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
  5. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.

## Navigate pagination through body parameters#

If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:

  1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**
  2. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
  3. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.
  4. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.
  5. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
  6. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

## Set the page size in the query#

If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:

  1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
  2. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.
  3. In **Value** , enter your page size.

# Securing n8n#

Securing your n8n instance can take several forms.

At a high level, you can:

  * Conduct a [security audit](../security-audit/) to identify security risks.
  * [Set up SSL](../set-up-ssl/) to enforce secure connections.
  * [Set up Single Sign-On](../set-up-sso/) for user account management.
  * Use [two-factor authentication (2FA)](../../../user-management/two-factor-auth/) for your users.

More granularly, consider blocking or opting out of features or data collection you don't want:

  * [Disable the public API](../disable-public-api/) if you aren't using it.
  * [Opt out of data collection](../telemetry-opt-out/) of the anonymous data n8n collects automatically.
  * [Block certain nodes](../blocking-nodes/) from being available to your users.

# OpenAI Chat Model node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [OpenAI Chat Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters#

The OpenAI Chat Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you#

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

  1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

  * Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
  * Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
  * Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
  * Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
  * Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
  * Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

In n8n:

  * check that the [OpenAI credentials](../../../../credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
  * ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](../../../../credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters#

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

# Hosting n8n on Hetzner cloud#

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on a Hetzner cloud server. It uses:

  * [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Server from the internet.
  * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Create a server#

  1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
  2. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **\+ NEW PROJECT**.
  3. Select **\+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.

You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select "Docker CE" from the **APPS** tab.

Type

When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.

SSH keys

Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.

## Log in to your server#

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg) for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.

## Install Docker Compose#

The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:

    1
    2

|

    apt update && apt -y upgrade
    apt install docker-compose-plugin

---|---

## Clone configuration repository#

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

    1

|

    git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git

---|---

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

    1

|

    cd n8n-docker-caddy

---|---

## Default folders and files#

The host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

  * `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
  * `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volume#

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

    1

|

    docker volume create caddy_data

---|---

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

    1

|

    sudo docker volume create n8n_data

---|---

## Set up DNS#

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).

## Open ports#

n8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands:

    1
    2

|

    sudo ufw allow 80
    sudo ufw allow 443

---|---

## Configure n8n#

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

    1

|

    nano .env

---|---

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file#

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

  * The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
  * The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

    1

|

    nano docker-compose.yml

---|---

## Configure Caddy#

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

    1

|

    nano caddy_config/Caddyfile

---|---

Change the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {
        reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
          flush_interval -1
        }
    }

---|---

## Start Docker Compose#

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

    1

|

    docker compose up -d

---|---

This may take a few minutes.

## Test your setup#

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy#

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

    1

|

    sudo docker compose stop

---|---

## Updating#

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    # Navigate to the directory containing your docker compose file
    cd </path/to/your/compose/file/directory>

    # Pull latest version
    docker compose pull

    # Stop and remove older version
    docker compose down

    # Start the container
    docker compose up -d

---|---

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# hosting/securing/security-audit/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/securing/security-audit.md "Edit this page")

# Security audit#

You can run a security audit on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

## Run an audit#

You can run an audit using the CLI, the public API, or the n8n node.

### CLI#

Run `n8n audit`.

### API#

Make a `POST` call to the `/audit` endpoint. You must authenticate as the instance owner.

### n8n node#

Add the [n8n node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to your workflow. Select **Resource** > **Audit** and **Operation** > **Generate**.

## Report contents#

The audit generates five risk reports:

### Credentials#

This report shows:

  * Credentials not used in a workflow.
  * Credentials not used in an active workflow.
  * Credentials not use in a recently active workflow.

### Database#

This report shows:

  * Expressions used in **Execute Query** fields in SQL nodes.
  * Expressions used in **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.
  * Unused **Query Parameters** fields in SQL nodes.

### File system#

This report lists nodes that interact with the file system.

### Nodes#

This report shows:

  * Official risky nodes. These are n8n built in nodes. You can use them to fetch and run any code on the host system, which exposes the instance to exploits. You can view the list in [n8n code | Audit constants](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/security-audit/constants.ts#L51), under `OFFICIAL_RISKY_NODE_TYPES`.
  * Community nodes.
  * Custom nodes.

### Instance#

This report shows:

  * Unprotected webhooks in the instance.
  * Missing security settings
  * If your instance is outdated.

# integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Structured Output Parser node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Structured Output Parser node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters#

The Structured Output Parser node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes#

You can attach output parser nodes to select [AI root nodes](../../../root-nodes/).

To add the Structured Output Parser to a node, enable the **Require Specific Output Format** option in the AI root node you wish to format. Once the option is enabled, a new **output parser** attachment point is displayed. Click the **output parser** attachment point to add the Structured Output Parser node to the node.

## Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps#

The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages.

To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the **System Message** for the **AI Agent**. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results.

## Structuring output from agents#

Structured output parsing is often not reliable when working with [agents](../../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/).

If your workflow uses agents, n8n recommends using a separate [LLM-chain](../../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) to receive the data from the agent and parse it. This leads to better, more consistent results than parsing directly in the agent workflow.

# external-secrets/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/external-secrets.md "Edit this page")

# External secrets#

Feature availability

  * External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans.
  * n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault.
  * n8n doesn't support [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets).

You can use an external secrets store to manage [credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) for n8n.

n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple [n8n environments](../source-control-environments/) in one central place.

## Connect n8n to your secrets store#

Secret names

Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`), and underscores. n8n currently only supports plaintext values for secrets, not JSON objects or key-value pairs.

  1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **External Secrets**.
  2. Select **Set Up** for your store provider.
  3. Enter the credentials for your provider:

     * Azure Key Vault: Provide your **vault name** , **tenant ID** , **client ID** , and **client secret**. Refer to the Azure documentation to [register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.
     * AWS Secrets Manager: provide your **access key ID** , **secret access key** , and **region**. The IAM user must have the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`, `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue`, and `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permissions.

To give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user:

           1
            2
            3
            4
            5
            6
            7
            8
            9
           10
           11
           12
           13
           14
           15
           16
           17
           18

           {
           	"Version": "2012-10-17",
           	"Statement": [
           		{
           			"Sid": "AccessAllSecrets",
           			"Effect": "Allow",
           			"Action": [
           				"secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
           				"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue",
           				"secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy",
           				"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
           				"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
           				"secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds",
           			],
           			"Resource": "*"
           		}
           	]
           }

---|---

You can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` and `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values.

Next, you need set the scope for the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets.

For example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with `n8n` in your specified AWS account and region:

           1
            2
            3
            4
            5

For more IAM permission policy examples, consult the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_iam-policies.html#auth-and-access_examples_batch).

     * HashiCorp Vault: provide the **Vault URL** for your vault instance, and select your **Authentication Method**. Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace.

       * Refer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method: [Token auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token)
[AppRole auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle)
[Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass)
       * If you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to [Vault Enterprise namespaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces.
     * Infisical: provide a **Service Token**. Refer to Infisical's [Service token](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/token) documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the **Site URL**.

Infisical environment

Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment.

Infisical folders

n8n doesn't support [Infisical folders](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/folder).

     * Google Cloud Platform: provide a **Service Account Key** (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` and `Secret Manager Secret Viewer`. Refer to Google's [service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) for more information.

  4. **Save** your configuration.

  5. Enable the provider using the **Disabled / Enabled** toggle.

## Use secrets in n8n credentials#

To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:

  1. Create a new credential, or open an existing one.
  2. On the field where you want to use a secret:
     1. Hover over the field.
     2. Select **Expression**.
  3. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an [expression](../glossary/#expression-n8n) referencing the secret name:

         1

|

         {{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }}

---|---

`<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.

## Using external secrets with n8n environments#

n8n's [Source control and environments](../source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.

For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.

## Using external secrets in projects#

To use external secrets in an [RBAC project](../user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](../user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.

## Troubleshooting#

### Infisical version changes#

Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.

### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin#

Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.

Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/understand/environments.md "Edit this page")

# Environments in n8n#

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. This document helps you understand:

  * The purpose of environments.
  * How environments work in n8n.

## Environments: What and why#

In software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments).

Low-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.

There are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:

  * Development: do work and make changes.
  * Production: the live environment.

A setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.

## Environments in n8n#

In n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:

  * The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.
  * The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](../../using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed).

How you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:

  * Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.
  * Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](../../using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.

For detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](../../using/push-pull/).

Refer to [Set up source control](../../setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](../../create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations.

# HubSpot Trigger node#

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) provides tools for social media marketing, content management, web analytics, landing pages, customer support, and search engine optimization.

Webhooks

If you activate a second trigger, the previous trigger stops working. This is because the trigger registers a new webhook with HubSpot when activated. HubSpot only allows one webhook at a time.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/hubspot/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [HubSpot Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/hubspot-trigger/) page.

# Processing data with code#

## Function#

A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript or Python code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.

The [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can create any function you want using JavaScript code.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/community-nodes/usage.md "Edit this page")

# Using community nodes#

To use community nodes, you first need to [install](../installation/) them.

## Adding community nodes to your workflow#

After installing a community node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel. n8n marks community nodes with a **Package** ![Package icon](../../../_images/common-icons/package.png) icon in the nodes panel.

## Community nodes with duplicate names#

It's possible for several community nodes to have the same name. If you use two nodes with the same name in your workflow, they'll look the same, unless they have different icons.

# Google Docs node#

Use the Google Docs node to automate work in Google Docs, and integrate Google Docs with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Google Docs features, including creating, updating, and getting documents.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Google Docs node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [Google Docs credentials](../../credentials/google/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Operations#

  * Document
    * Create
    * Get

## What to do if your operation isn't supported#

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
  2. Select the service you want to connect to.
  3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

# integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method.md "Edit this page")

# Choose your node building approach#

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

  * Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
  * Is more future-proof.
  * Supports integration with REST APIs.

The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:

  * Trigger nodes
  * Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
  * Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
  * Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](../../build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on types of versioning.

## Data handling differences#

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](../../build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.

## Syntax differences#

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

# External hooks environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

You can define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. Refer to [Backend hooks](../../../../embed/configuration/#backend-hooks) for examples of available hooks and [Hook files](../../../../embed/configuration/#backend-hook-files) for information on file formatting.

Variable | Type | Description
---|---|---
`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES` | String | Files containing backend external hooks. Provide multiple files as a colon-separated list ("`:`").
`EXTERNAL_FRONTEND_HOOKS_URLS` | String | URLs to files containing frontend external hooks. Provide multiple URLs as a colon-separated list ("`:`").

# integrations/builtin/credentials/rabbitmq/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/rabbitmq.md "Edit this page")

# RabbitMQ credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [RabbitMQ](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmq/)
  * [RabbitMQ Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmqtrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * User connection

## Related resources#

Refer to [RabbitMQ's Connections documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/connections) for more information about the service.

## Using user connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need to have a [RabbitMQ broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) installed and:

  1. Enter the **Hostname** for the RabbitMQ broker.
  2. Enter the **Port** the connection should use.
  3. Enter a **User** the connection should use to log in as.
     * The default is `guest`. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to [Access Control | The Basics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#basics) for more information. If you're using the `guest` account with a non-localhost connection, refer to `guest` user issues below for troubleshooting tips.
  4. Enter the user's **Password**.
     * The default password for the `guest` user is `guest`.
  5. Enter the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts) the connection should use as the **Vhost**. The default virtual host is `/`.
  6. Select whether the connection should use **SSL**. If turned on, also set:
     * **Passwordless** : Select whether the SSL certificate connection users SASL mechanism EXTERNAL (turned off) or doesn't use a password (turned on). If turned on, you'll also need to enter:
       * The **Client Certificate** : Paste the text of the SSL client certificate to use.
       * The **Client Key** : Paste the SSL client key to use.
       * The **Passphrase** : Paste the SSL passphrase to use.
     * **CA Certificates** : Paste the text of the SSL CA certificates to use.

## guest user issues#

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:

    1

|

    [error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost

---|---

This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

  * Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
  * Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to ["guest" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/index.md "Edit this page")

# Send Email credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Send Email](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.
  * Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * SMTP account

## Related resources#

Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.

## Using SMTP account#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **User** email address
  * A **Password** : This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
  * The **Host** : The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
  * A **Port** number: The default is port `465`, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are `587` for TLS or `25` for no encryption. Check with your provider.
  * **SSL/TLS** : When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.
  * **Disable STARTTLS** : When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
  * **Client Host Name** : If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.

### Provider instructions#

Refer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.

#### Gmail#

Refer to [Gmail](gmail/).

#### Outlook.com#

Refer to [Outlook.com](outlook/).

#### Yahoo#

Refer to [Yahoo](yahoo/).

### My provider isn't listed#

If your email provider isn't listed here, search for `SMTP settings` to find their instructions. (These instructions may also be included with `IMAP settings` or `POP settings`.)

# Tools AI Agent node#

The Tools Agent uses external [tools](../../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.

This agent has an enhanced ability to work with tools and can ensure a standard output format.

The Tools Agent implements [Langchain's tool calling](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) interface. This interface describes available tools and their schemas. The agent also has improved output parsing capabilities, as it passes the parser to the model as a formatting tool.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

This agent supports the following chat models:

  * [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/)
  * [Groq Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgroq/)
  * [Mistral Cloud Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatmistralcloud/)
  * [Anthropic Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatanthropic/)
  * [Azure OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatazureopenai/)

The Tools Agent can use the following tools...

  * [Call n8n Workflow](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/)
  * [Code](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/)
  * [HTTP Request](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/)
  * [Action Network](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.actionnetwork/)
  * [ActiveCampaign](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.activecampaign/)
  * [Affinity](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.affinity/)
  * [Agile CRM](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.agilecrm/)

## Node parameters#

Configure the Tools Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt#

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

  * **Take from previous node automatically** : If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
  * **Define below** : If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format#

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

  * [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
  * [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
  * [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options#

Refine the Tools Agent node's behavior using these options:

### System Message#

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Max Iterations#

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

Defaults to `10`.

### Return Intermediate Steps#

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

### Automatically Passthrough Binary Images#

Use this option to control whether binary images should be automatically passed through to the agent as image type messages (turned on) or not (turned off).

## Templates and examples#

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Dynamic parameters for tools with `$fromAI()`#

To learn how to dynamically populate parameters for app node tools, refer to [Let AI specify tool parameters with `$fromAI()`](../../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Common issues#

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).

## AI glossary#

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
  * **vector store** : A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

# AI Agent node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [AI Agent node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'#

A full error message might look like this:

    1
    2
    3

|

    Internal error
    Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null.
    <stack-trace>

---|---

This error can occur if the **Prompt** input contains a null value.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

  1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
     * To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
  2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
     * To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## Error in sub-node Simple Memory#

This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Simple Memory](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) sub-node.

It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Simple memory node (previously known as "Window Buffer Memory").

Try removing the Simple Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.

## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error#

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.

To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.

## No prompt specified error#

This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/).

To resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/nocodb/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/nocodb.md "Edit this page")

# NocoDB credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [NocoDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nocodb/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API token (recommended)
  * User auth token

User auth token deprecation

NocoDB deprecated user auth tokens in v0.205.1. Use API tokens instead.

## Related resources#

Refer to [NocoDB's API documentation](https://data-apis-v2.nocodb.com/) for more information about the service.

## Using API token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [NocoDB](https://www.nocodb.com/) instance and:

  * An **API Token**
  * Your database **Host**

To generate an API token:

  1. Log into NocoDB and select the **User menu** in the bottom left sidebar.
  2. Select **Account Settings**.
  3. Open the **Tokens** tab.
  4. Select **Add new API token**.
  5. Enter a **Name** for your token, like `n8n integration`.
  6. Select **Save**.
  7. Copy the **API Token** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  8. Enter the **Host** of your NocoDB instance in your n8n credential, for example `http://localhost:8080`.

Refer to the NocoDB [API Tokens documentation](https://docs.nocodb.com/account-settings/api-tokens/) for more detailed instructions.

## Using user auth token#

Before NocoDB deprecated it, user auth token was a temporary token designed for quick experiments with the API, valid for a session until the user logs out or for 10 hours.

User auth token deprecation

NocoDB deprecated user auth tokens in v0.205.1. Use API tokens instead.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [NocoDB](https://www.nocodb.com/) instance and:

  * A **User Token**
  * Your database **Host**

To generate a user auth token:

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters.md "Edit this page")

# Programmatic-style parameters#

These are the parameters available for [node base file](../) of programmatic-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a programmatic-style node](../../../programmatic-style-node/).

Programmatic-style nodes also use the `execute()` method. Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](../programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information.

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `defaultVersion`#

_Number_ | _Optional_

Use `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`#

_Object_ | _Optional_

Contains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.

For example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:

    	methods = {
    		loadOptions: {
    			// Get all the labels and display them
    			async getLabels(
    				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions,
    			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {
    				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
    				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(
    					this,
    					'labels',
    					'GET',
    					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',
    				);
    				for (const label of labels) {
    					const labelName = label.name;
    					const labelId = label.id;
    					returnData.push({
    						name: labelName,
    						value: labelId,
    					});
    				}
    				return returnData;
    			},
    		},
    	};

---|---

## `version`#

_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

Use `version` when using the light versioning approach.

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

# source-control-environments/understand/git/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/understand/git.md "Edit this page")

# Git and n8n#

n8n uses Git to provide source control. To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.

New to Git and source control?

If you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.

Familiar with Git and source control?

If you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.

This page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](../../setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.

This is a brief introduction

Git is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources).

## Git overview#

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## Branches: Multiple copies of a project#

Git uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.

![Diagram](../../../_images/source-control-environments/simple-git-branch.png)

## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider#

A common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.

n8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.

## Push, pull, and commit#

n8n uses three key Git processes:

  * **Push** : send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.
  * **Pull** : get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items.

Pulling overwrites your work

If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.

  * **Commit** : a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.

Refer to [Push and pull](../../using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git.

# Enable modules in Code node#

For security reasons, the Code node restricts importing modules. It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:

  * `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`: For built-in modules
  * `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`: For external modules sourced from n8n/node_modules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/index.md "Edit this page")

# Root nodes#

Root nodes are the foundational nodes within a group of cluster nodes.

[Cluster nodes](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
  * **vector store** : A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

# data/data-pinning/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-pinning.md "Edit this page")

# Data pinning#

You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions.

You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:

  * If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
  * If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
  * You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.

You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output ("error" outputs don't count for this purpose).

For development only

Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

## Pin data#

To pin data in a node:

  1. Run the node to load data.
  2. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** ![Pin data icon](../../_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png). When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Unpin data#

When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the **Unpin** link in the banner.

# WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [WhatsApp Business Cloud node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters#

This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.

To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.

Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) or [set a fallback value](../../../../../code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.

## Working with non-text media#

The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.

If your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.

For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to "n8n", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/licenses.md "Edit this page")

# License environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

To enable certain licensed features, you must first activate your license. You can do this either through the UI or by setting environment variables. For more information, see [license key](../../../../license-key/).

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`N8N_HIDE_USAGE_PAGE` | boolean | `false` | Hide the usage and plans page in the app.
`N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` | String | `''` | Activation key to initialize license. Not applicable if the n8n instance was already activated.
`N8N_LICENSE_AUTO_RENEW_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enables (true) or disables (false) autorenewal for licenses.
If disabled, you need to manually renew the license every 10 days by navigating to **Settings** > **Usage and plan** , and pressing `F5`. Failure to renew the license will disable all licensed features.
`N8N_LICENSE_DETACH_FLOATING_ON_SHUTDOWN` | Boolean | `true` | Controls whether the instance releases [floating entitlements](../../../../glossary/#entitlement-n8n) back to the pool upon shutdown. Set to `true` to allow other instances to reuse the entitlements, or `false` to retain them.
For production instances that must always keep their licensed features, set this to `false`.
`N8N_LICENSE_SERVER_URL` | String | `https://license.n8n.io/v1` | Server URL to retrieve license.
`N8N_LICENSE_TENANT_ID` | Number | `1` | Tenant ID associated with the license. Only set this variable if explicitly instructed by n8n.
`https_proxy_license_server` | String | `https://user:pass@proxy:port` | Proxy server URL for HTTPS requests to retrieve license. This variable name needs to be lowercase.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access key

## Related resources#

Refer to [AWS's Identity and Access Management documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started.html) for more information about the service.

## Using API access key#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account and:

  * Your AWS **Region**
  * The **Access Key ID** : Generated when you create an access key.
  * The **Secret Access Key** : Generated when you create an access key.

To create an access key and set up the credential:

  1. In your n8n credential, select your AWS **Region**.
  2. Log in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).
  3. In the navigation bar on the upper right, select your user name and then select **Security credentials**.
  4. In the **Access keys** section, select **Create access key**.
  5. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives page**, choose your use case. If it doesn't prompt you to create an access key, select **Other**.
  6. Select **Next**.
  7. Set a **description** tag value for the access key to make it easier to identify, for example `n8n integration`.
  8. Select **Create access key**.
  9. Reveal the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** and enter them in n8n.
  10. To use a **Temporary security credential** , turn that option on and add a **Session token**. Refer to the [AWS Temporary security credential documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) for more information on working with temporary security credentials.
  11. If you use [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) to host n8n, you can establish a connection between your VPC and some apps. Use **Custom Endpoints** to enter relevant custom endpoint(s) for this connection. This setup works with these apps:
     * Rekognition
     * Lambda
     * SNS
     * SES
     * SQS
     * S3

You can also generate access keys through the AWS CLI and AWS API. Refer to the [AWS Managing Access Keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for instructions on generating access keys using these methods.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/kafka/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/kafka.md "Edit this page")

# Kafka credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Kafka](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafka/)
  * [Kafka Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafkatrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Client ID

## Related resources#

Refer to [Kafka's documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) for more information about using the service.

If you're new to Kafka, refer to the [Apache Kafka Quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) for initial setup.

Refer to [Encryption and Authentication using SSL](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_ssl) for working with SSL in Kafka.

## Using client ID#

To configure this credential, you'll need a running Kafka environment and:

  * A **Client ID**
  * A list of relevant **Brokers**
  * Username/password authentication details if your Kafka environment uses authentication

To set it up:

  1. Enter the `CLIENT-ID` of the client or consumer group in the **Client ID** field in your credential.
  2. Enter a comma-separated list of relevant **Brokers** for the credential to use in the format `<broker-service-name>:<port>`. Use the name you gave the broker when you defined it in the `services` list. For example, `kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092` would add the brokers `kafka-1` and `kafka-2` on port `9092`.
  3. If your Kafka environment doesn't use SSL, turn off the **SSL** toggle.
  4. If you've enabled authentication using SASL in your Kafka environment, turn on the **Authentication** toggle. Then add:
     1. The **Username**
     2. The **Password**
     3. Select the broker's configured **SASL Mechanism**. Refer to [SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_config) for more information. Options include:
        * `Plain`
        * `scram-sha-256`
        * `scram-sha-512`

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout.md "Edit this page")

# Split Out#

Use the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items. For example, a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.

## Node parameters#

Configure this node using the following parameters.

### Field to Split Out#

Enter the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.

If you're working with binary data inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.

### Include#

Select whether and how you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item.

You can select:

  * **No Other Fields** : No other fields will be included.
  * **All Other Fields** : All other fields will be included.
  * **Selected Other Fields** : Only the selected fields will be included.
    * **Fields to Include** : Enter a comma separated list of the fields you want to include.

## Node options#

### Disable Dot Notation#

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Destination Field Name#

Enter the field in the output where the split field contents should go.

### Include Binary#

Choose whether to include binary data from the input in the new output (turned on) or not (turned off).

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/index.md "Edit this page")

# Execute Command#

The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.

Which shell runs the command?

This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, `cmd` on Windows and `zsh` on macOS.

If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

Not available on Cloud

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Node parameters#

Configure the node using the following parameters.

### Execute Once#

Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).

### Command#

Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running multiple commands and cURL commands.

#### Run multiple commands#

Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:

  * Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.

        1

|

        cd bin && ls

---|---

  * Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.

        1
        2

|

        cd bin
        ls

---|---

#### Run cURL command#

You can also use the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to make a cURL request.

If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.

  1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.
  2. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.

         1
         2
         3
         4

|

         FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
         USER root
         RUN apk --update add curl
         USER node

---|---

  3. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.

         1

|

         docker build -t n8n-curl

---|---

  4. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.

  5. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolthink.md "Edit this page")

# Think Tool node#

The Think Tool node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that invites an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to do some thinking before answering. Essentially, it allows the agent to reflect on the question by talking to itself before providing an answer. In particular, this is useful for complex queries that require a thoughtful response.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

### Prompting example#

As an example, say you ask the agent:

> _Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we don't know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?_

The agent will do its thinking with the tool:

> _We have the following information: 1. Jack is looking at Anne. 2. Anne is looking at George. 3. Jack is married. 4. George is not married. 5. We don't know if Anne is married or not._
>
> _We need to determine if a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Let's consider both cases for Anne:_
>
> _Case 1: Anne is married._
>
>   * _If Anne is married, then she (married) is looking at George (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George)._
>

>
> _Case 2: Anne is unmarried._
>
>   * _If Anne is unmarried, then Jack (married) is looking at Anne (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne)._
>

>
> _In both scenarios, we find that a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes._

and then afterward provide the answer:

> _Yes, a married person is looking at an unmarried person. In both possible scenarios regarding Anne's marital status, we find that a married individual (either Jack or Anne) is looking at an unmarried individual (either George or Anne)._

# sustainable-use-license/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/sustainable-use-license.md "Edit this page")

# Sustainable Use License#

Proprietary licenses for Enterprise

Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. [Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.

n8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

## License FAQs#

### What license do you use?#

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?#

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:

  * Content of branches other than master.
  * Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md).

### What is the Sustainable Use License?#

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this here. The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

  * You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
  * You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
  * You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?#

Our license restricts use to "internal business purposes". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

  * White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.
  * Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license:

  * Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.
  * Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.
  * Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.
  * Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.

#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?#

Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.

Here are two examples to clarify:

##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot#

Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.

**NOT ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.

##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app#

Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.

**ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.

### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?#

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed).

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples, and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why don't you use an open source license?#

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license?#

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

  1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
  2. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

  1. To be as permissive as possible.
  2. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
  3. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?#

Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples, and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?#

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).

### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?#

n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?#

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to "sell" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is n8n open source?#

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?#

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

  * Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
  * Has its source code openly available.
  * Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
  * Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?#

Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

# workflows/subworkflow-conversion/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/subworkflow-conversion.md "Edit this page")

# Sub-workflow conversion#

Feature availability

Available on all plans from n8n version 1.97.0.

Use sub-workflow conversion to refactor your workflows into reusable parts. Expressions referencing other nodes are automatically updated and added as parameters in the [Execute Workflow Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) node.

See [sub-workflows](../../flow-logic/subworkflows/) for a general introduction to the concept.

## Selecting nodes for a sub-workflow#

To convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow, you must select the nodes in the original workflow that you want to convert.

Do this by selecting a group of valid nodes. The selection must be continuous and must connect to the rest of the workflow from at most one start node and one end node. The selection must fulfill these conditions:

  * Must not include trigger nodes.
  * Only a single node in the selection can have incoming connections from nodes _outside_ of the selection.
    * That node can have multiple incoming connections, but only a single input _branch_ (which means it can't be a [Merge node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) for example).
    * That node can't have incoming connections from other nodes in the selection.
  * Only a single node in the selection can have outgoing connections to nodes _outside_ of the selection.
    * That node can have multiple outgoing connections, but only a single output branch (it can't be an [If node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) for example).
    * That node can't have outgoing connections to other nodes in the selection.
  * The selection must include all nodes between the input and output nodes.

## How to convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow#

Select the desired nodes on the canvas. Right-click the canvas background and select **Convert to sub-workflow**.

## Things to keep in mind#

Most sub-workflow conversions work without issues, but there are some caveats and limitations to keep in mind:

  * **You must set type constraints for input and output manually** : By default, sub-workflow input and output allow all types. You can set expected types in sub-workflow's [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) and [Edit Fields (set) node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) (labeled as **Return** and only included if the sub-workflow has outputs).
  * **Limited support for AI nodes** : When dealing with sub-nodes like AI tools, you must select them all and may need to duplicate any nodes shared with other AI Agents before conversion.
  * **Uses v1 execution ordering:** New workflows use [`v1` execution ordering](../../flow-logic/execution-order/) regardless of the parent workflow's settings - you can change this back in the settings.
  * **Accessor functions like`first()`, `last()`, and `all()` require extra care**: Expressions using these functions don't always translate cleanly to a sub-workflow context. n8n may transform them to try to preserve their functionality, but you should check that they work as intended in their new context.

Sub-node parameter suffixes

n8n adds suffixes like `_firstItem`, `_lastItem`, and `_allItems` to variable names accessed by these functions. This helps preserve information about the original expression, since item ordering may be different in the sub-workflow context.

  * **The`itemMatching` function requires a fixed index**: You can't use expressions for the index value when using the [`itemMatching` function](../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/). You must pass it a fixed number.

# license-key/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/license-key.md "Edit this page")

# License Key#

To enable certain licensed features, you must first activate your license. You can do this either through the UI or by setting environment variables.

## Add a license key using the UI#

In your n8n instance:

  1. Log in as **Admin** or **Owner**.
  2. Select **Settings** > **Usage and plan**.
  3. Select **Enter activation key**.
  4. Paste in your license key.
  5. Select **Activate**.

## Add a license key using an environment variables#

In your n8n configuration, set `N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` to your license key. If the instance already has an activated license, this variable will have no effect.

Refer to [Environment variables](../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) to learn more about configuring n8n.

## Allowlist the license server IP addresses#

n8n uses Cloudflare to host the license server. As the specific IP addresses can change, you need to allowlist the [full range of Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) to ensure n8n can always reach the license server.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/azureopenai/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/azureopenai.md "Edit this page")

# Azure OpenAI credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Chat Azure OpenAI](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatazureopenai/)
  * [Embeddings Azure OpenAI](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsazureopenai/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Create an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) subscription.
  * Access to Azure OpenAI within that subscription. You may need to [request access](https://aka.ms/oai/access) if your organization doesn't yet have it.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key
  * Azure Entra ID (OAuth2)

## Related resources#

Refer to [Azure OpenAI's API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Resource Name** : the **Name** you give the resource
  * An **API key** : **Key 1** works well. This can be accessed before deployment in **Keys and Endpoint**.
  * The **API Version** the credentials should use. See the [Azure OpenAI API preview lifecycle documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation) for more information about API versioning in Azure OpenAI.

To get the information above, [create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).

Model name for Azure OpenAI nodes

Once you deploy the resource, use the **Deployment name** as the model name for the Azure OpenAI nodes where you're using this credential.

## Using Azure Entra ID (OAuth2)#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

  1. Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
  2. Generate a client secret for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

### Register an application#

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

  1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
  2. Select **Register an application**.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your app.
  4. In **Supported account types** , select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
  5. In **Register an application** :
     1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
     2. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
     3. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
  6. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
  7. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret#

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

  1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
  2. In **Client secrets** , select **\+ New client secret**.
  3. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
  4. Select **Add**.
  5. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
  6. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
  7. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
  8. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

## Setting custom scopes#

Azure Entra ID credentials use the following scopes by default:

  * [`openid`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-openid-scope)
  * [`offline_access`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-offline_access-scope)
  * [`AccessReview.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#accessreviewreadwriteall)
  * [`Directory.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryreadwriteall)
  * [`NetworkAccessPolicy.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#networkaccesspolicyreadwriteall)
  * [`DelegatedAdminRelationship.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#delegatedadminrelationshipreadwriteall)
  * [`EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#entitlementmanagementreadwriteall)
  * [`User.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#userreadwriteall)
  * [`Directory.AccessAsUser.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryaccessasuserall)
  * [`Sites.FullControl.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#sitesfullcontrolall)
  * [`GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#groupmemberreadwriteall)

To select different scopes for your credentials, enable the **Custom Scopes** slider and edit the **Enabled Scopes** list. Keep in mind that some features may not work as expected with more restrictive scopes.

# Workflow templates#

When creating a new workflow, you can choose whether to start with an empty workflow, or use an existing [template](../../glossary/#template-n8n).

Templates provide:

  * Help getting started: n8n might already have a template that does what you need.
  * Examples of what you can build
  * Best practices for creating your own workflows

## Access templates#

Select ![View templates icon](../../_images/common-icons/templates.png) **Templates** to view the templates library.

If you use n8n's template library, this takes you to browse [Workflows on the n8n website](https://n8n.io/workflows/). If you use a custom library provided by your organization, you'll be able to search and browse the templates within the app.

## Add your workflow to the n8n library#

You can submit your workflows to n8n's template library.

n8n is working on a creator program, and developing a marketplace of templates. This is an ongoing project, and details are likely to change.

Refer to [n8n Creator hub](https://www.notion.so/n8n/n8n-Creator-hub-7bd2cbe0fce0449198ecb23ff4a2f76f) for information on how to submit templates and become a creator.

## Self-hosted n8n: Disable templates#

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` to false.

## Self-hosted n8n: Use your own library#

In your environment variables, set `N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST` to the base URL of your API.

### Endpoints#

Your API must provide the same endpoints and data structure as n8n's.

The endpoints are:

Method | Path
---|---
GET | /templates/workflows/`<id>`
GET | /templates/search
GET | /templates/collections/`<id>`
GET | /templates/collections
GET | /templates/categories
GET | /health

### Query parameters#

The `/templates/search` endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`page` | integer | The page of results to return
`rows` | integer | The maximum number of results to return per page
`category` | comma-separated list of strings (categories) | The categories to search within
`search` | string | The search query

The `/templates/collections` endpoint accepts the following query parameters:

Parameter | Type | Description
---|---|---
`category` | comma-separated list of strings (categories) | The categories to search within
`search` | string | The search query

### Data schema#

You can explore the data structure of the items in the response object returned by endpoints here:

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/executions/debug.md "Edit this page")

# Debug and re-run past executions#

Feature availability

Available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

You can load data from a previous execution into your current workflow. This is useful for debugging data from failed production executions: you can see a failed execution, make changes to your workflow to fix it, then re-run it with the previous execution data.

## Load data#

To load data from a previous execution:

  1. In your workflow, select the **Executions** tab to view the **Executions** list.
  2. Select the execution you want to debug. n8n displays options depending on whether the workflow was successful or failed:
     * For failed executions: select **Debug in editor**.
     * For successful executions: select **Copy to editor**.
  3. n8n copies the execution data into your current workflow, and [pins the data](../../../data/data-pinning/) in the first node in the workflow.

Check which executions you save

The executions available on the **Executions** list depends on your [Workflow settings](../../settings/).

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Code node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Code node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Code doesn't return items properly#

This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    [
      {
        "json": {
    	  // your data goes here
    	}
      }
    ]

---|---

To troubleshoot this error, check the following:

  * Read the [data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
  * Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](../../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/).

## A 'json' property isn't an object#

This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.

This may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    [
      {
        "json": [
    	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
    	]
      }
    ]

---|---

To resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    [
      {
        "json": {
    	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
    	}
      }
    ]

---|---

## Code doesn't return an object#

This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.

To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/):

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    [
      {
        "json": {
    	  // your data goes here
    	}
      }
    ]

---|---

This error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.

## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level#

This error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.

To resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    // Original code:
    // import express from "express";
    // New code:
    const express = require("express");

---|---

## Cannot find module '<module>'#

This error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.

Only for self-hosted

n8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](../../../../../manage-cloud/overview/) version.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/) n8n, follow these steps:

  * Install the module into your n8n environment.
    * If you are running n8n with [npm](../../../../../hosting/installation/npm/), install the module in the same environment as n8n.
    * If you are running n8n with [Docker](../../../../../hosting/installation/docker/), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your module.
  * Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) to allow importing modules.

## Using global variables#

Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.

To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](../../../../../code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.

Use Remove Duplicates when possible

If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](../../n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.

# OpenAI Chat Model node#

Use the OpenAI Chat Model node to use OpenAI's chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenAI Chat Model node and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

### Model#

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenAI and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Node options#

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

### Base URL#

Enter a URL here to override the default URL for the API.

### Frequency Penalty#

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens#

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

### Response Format#

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

### Presence Penalty#

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature#

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

### Timeout#

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

### Max Retries#

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

### Top P#

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql.md "Edit this page")

# MySQL credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [MySQL](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)
  * [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)

Agent node users

The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.

## Prerequisites#

Create a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server database.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Database connection

## Related resources#

Refer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The server **Host** : The database's host name or IP address.
  * The **Database** name.
  * A **User** name.
  * A **Password** for that user.
  * The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.
  * **Connect Timeout** : The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.
  * **SSL** : If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.
  * **SSH Tunnel** : Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.

To set up your database connection credential:

  1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:

         1

|

         SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';

---|---

  2. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:

         1

|

         SHOW DATABASES;

---|---

  3. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.

  4. Enter the **Password** for that user.
  5. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:

         1

|

         SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';

---|---

  6. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `10000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 1000 before entering it in n8n:

         1

|

         SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';

---|---

  7. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:

     1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.
     2. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.
     3. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.
  8. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:
     1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
        * Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
        * Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.
     2. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
     3. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
     4. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
     5. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with** , add the **SSH Password**.
     6. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with** :
        1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.
        2. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.

Refer to [MySQL | Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-ssl-rsa-files.html) for more information on working with SSL certificates in MySQL. Refer to [MySQL | Using an SSH Tunnel](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connection-ssh.html) for more information on working with SSH tunnels in MySQL.

# hosting/securing/set-up-ssl/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/securing/set-up-ssl.md "Edit this page")

# Set up SSL#

There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.

## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)#

Use a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.

Refer to [Security | Data encryption](https://n8n.io/legal/#security) for more information.

## Pass certificates into n8n directly#

You can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.

You'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.

Refer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these variables and [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

![Multiple rows](../../../../../_images/integrations/creating-nodes/multiple-rows.png)

### Support drag and drop for data keys#

Users can drag and drop data values to map them to fields. Dragging and dropping creates an [expression](../../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to load the data value. n8n supports this automatically.

You need to add an extra configuration option to support dragging and dropping data keys:

  * `requiresDataPath: 'single'`: for fields that require a single string.
  * `requiresDataPath: 'multiple'`: for fields that can accept a comma-separated list of string.

The [Compare Datasets node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/CompareDatasets/CompareDatasets.node.ts) has examples.

## Resource locator#

![Resource locator](../../../../../_images/integrations/creating-nodes/resource-locator.png)

The resource locator element helps users find a specific resource in an external service, such as a card or label in Trello.

The following options are available:

  * ID
  * URL
  * List: allows users to select or search from a prepopulated list. This option requires more coding, as you must populate the list, and handle searching if you choose to support it.

You can choose which types to include.

## Resource mapper#

If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.

Mapping and matching

Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update.

## HTML#

The HTML editor allows users to create HTML templates in their workflows. The editor supports standard HTML, CSS in `<style>` tags, and expressions wrapped in `{{}}`. Users can add `<script>` tags to pull in additional JavaScript. n8n doesn't run this JavaScript during workflow execution.

![Notice](../../../../../_images/integrations/creating-nodes/notice.png)

## Hints#

There are two types of hints: parameter hints and node hints:

  * Parameter hints are small lines of text below a user input field.
  * Node hints are a more powerful and flexible option than Notice. Use them to display longer hints, in the input panel, output panel, or node details view.

### Add a parameter hint#

Add the `hint` parameter to a UI element:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    {
    	displayName: 'URL',
    	name: 'url',
    	type: 'string',
    	hint: 'Enter a URL',
    	...
    }

---|---

### Add a node hint#

Define the node's hints in the `hints` property within the node `description`:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6

    description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    	...
    	hints: [
    		{
    			// The hint message. You can use HTML.
    			message: "This node has many input items. Consider enabling <b>Execute Once</b> in the node\'s settings.",
    			// Choose from: info, warning, danger. The default is 'info'.
    			// Changes the color. info (grey), warning (yellow), danger (red)
    			type: 'info',
    			// Choose from: inputPane, outputPane, ndv. By default n8n displays the hint in both the input and output panels.
    			location: 'outputPane',
    			// Choose from: always, beforeExecution, afterExecution. The default is 'always'
    			whenToDisplay: 'beforeExecution',
    			// Optional. An expression. If it resolves to true, n8n displays the message. Defaults to true.
    			displayCondition: '={{ $parameter["operation"] === "select" && $input.all().length > 1 }}'
    		}
    	]
    	...
    }

---|---

### Add a dynamic hint to a programmatic-style node#

In programmatic-style nodes you can create a dynamic message that includes information from the node execution. As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.

    if (operation === 'select' && items.length > 1 && !node.executeOnce) {
        // Expects two parameters: NodeExecutionData and an array of hints
    	return new NodeExecutionOutput(
    		[returnData],
    		[
    			{
    				message: `This node ran ${items.length} times, once for each input item. To run for the first item only, enable <b>Execute once</b> in the node settings.`,
    				location: 'outputPane',
    			},
    		],
    	);
    }
    return [returnData];

# integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter.md "Edit this page")

# n8n node linter#

n8n's node linter, [`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base), statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.

`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.

## Setup#

If using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.

If using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.VS Code-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.

Don't edit the configuration file

[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.

## Usage#

You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.

### Linting#

In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.

In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.

You can also run the linter manually:

  * Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console.
  * Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).

Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.

### Exceptions#

Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.

To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).

To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance.

# hosting/scaling/memory-errors/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/memory-errors.md "Edit this page")

# Memory-related errors#

n8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.

Only for self-hosted n8n

This page describes memory-related errors when [self-hosting n8n](../../). Visit [Cloud data management](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/) to learn about memory limits for [n8n Cloud](../../../manage-cloud/overview/).

## Identifying out of memory situations#

n8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.

Error messages including **Problem running workflow** , **Connection Lost** , or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable.

When self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs.

On n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.

## Typical causes#

Such problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:

  * Amount of [JSON data](../../../data/data-structure/).
  * Size of binary data.
  * Number of nodes in a workflow.
  * Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.
  * Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.
  * Additional workflows running at the same time.

## Avoiding out of memory situations#

When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.

### Increase available memory#

When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.

On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.

### Reduce memory consumption#

This approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.

  * Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
  * Avoid using the Code node where possible.
  * Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
  * Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

### Increase old memory#

This applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes) `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).

# Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app#

Only for instance owners of self-hosted n8n instances

Only the n8n instance owner of a self-hosted n8n instance can install and manage community nodes from npm. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.

Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.

## Install a community node#

To install a community node from npm:

  1. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**.
  2. Select **Install**.
  3. Find the node you want to install:
     1. Select **Browse**. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword `n8n-community-node-package`.
     2. Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
     3. Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
     4. Return to n8n.
  4. Enter the npm package name, and version number if required. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.
     * To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter `n8n-nodes-storms` in **Enter npm package name**.
     * To install version 2.3: enter `n8n-node-storms@2.3` in **Enter npm package name**.
  5. Agree to the [risks](../../risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.**
  6. Select **Install**. n8n installs the node, and returns to the **Community Nodes** list in **Settings**.

Nodes on the blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to [n8n community node blocklist](../../blocklist/) for more information.

## Uninstall a community node#

To uninstall a community node:

  1. Go to **Settings** > **Community nodes**.
  2. On the node you want to install, select **Options** ![Three dots options menu](../../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png).
  3. Select **Uninstall package**.
  4. Select **Uninstall Package** in the confirmation modal.

## Upgrade a community node#

Breaking changes in versions

Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can downgrade.

### Upgrade to the latest version#

You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in **Settings** > **community nodes**.

When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an **Update** button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.

### Upgrade to a specific version#

To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the Installation instructions for more guidance.

## Downgrade a community node#

If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.

To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the Installation instructions for more guidance.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/database.md "Edit this page")

# Database environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

By default, n8n uses SQLite. n8n also supports PostgreSQL. n8n [removed support for MySQL and MariaDB](../../../../1-0-migration-checklist/#mysql-and-mariadb) in v1.0.

This page outlines environment variables to configure your chosen database for your self-hosted n8n instance.

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`DB_TYPE`
/`_FILE` | Enum string:
`sqlite`, `postgresdb` | `sqlite` | The database to use.
`DB_TABLE_PREFIX` | * | - | Prefix to use for table names.
`DB_PING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Number | `2` | The interval, in seconds, between pings to the database to check if the connection is still alive.

## PostgreSQL#

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE`
/`_FILE` | String | `n8n` | The name of the PostgreSQL database.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST`
/`_FILE` | String | `localhost` | The PostgreSQL host.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT`
/`_FILE` | Number | `5432` | The PostgreSQL port.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_USER`
/`_FILE` | String | `postgres` | The PostgreSQL user.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD`
/`_FILE` | String | - | The PostgreSQL password.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_POOL_SIZE`
/`_FILE` | Number | `2` | Control how many parallel open Postgres connections n8n should have. Increasing it may help with resource utilization, but too many connections may degrade performance.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`
/`_FILE` | Number | `20000` | Postgres connection timeout (ms).
`DB_POSTGRESDB_IDLE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`
/`_FILE` | Number | `30000` | Amount of time before an idle connection is eligible for eviction for being idle.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA`
/`_FILE` | String | `public` | The PostgreSQL schema.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_ENABLED`
/`_FILE` | Boolean | `false` | Whether to enable SSL. Automatically enabled if `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA`, `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT` or `DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY` is defined.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA`
/`_FILE` | String | - | The PostgreSQL SSL certificate authority.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CERT`
/`_FILE` | String | - | The PostgreSQL SSL certificate.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_KEY`
/`_FILE` | String | - | The PostgreSQL SSL key.
`DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`
/`_FILE` | Boolean | `true` | If n8n should reject unauthorized SSL connections (true) or not (false).

## SQLite#

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE` | Number | `0` | Controls whether to open the SQLite file in [WAL mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) or [rollback journal mode](https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback). Uses rollback journal mode when set to zero. When greater than zero, uses WAL mode with the value determining the number of parallel SQL read connections to configure. WAL mode is much more performant and reliable than the rollback journal mode.
`DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` | Boolean | `false` | Runs [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation on startup to rebuild the database. Reduces file size and optimizes indexes. This is a long running blocking operation and increases start-up time.

# flow-logic/merging/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/merging.md "Edit this page")

# Merging data#

Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.

  * Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.
  * Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.
  * Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.

Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.

## Merge data from different data streams#

If your workflow [splits](../splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/)

## Merge data from different nodes#

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

![Merging data from two previous nodes. The diagram shows three nodes lined up sequentially. The first node is labeled Fetch data, the second is labeled Modify data, and the third is labeled Merge: append both data sets. Arrows connect nodes 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3.](../../_images/flow-logic/merging/merge-node-data.png) Merging data from two previous nodes

## Merge data from multiple node executions#

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](../looping/) scenarios.

Node executions and workflow executions

This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/) using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/)

## Compare, merge, and split again#

The [Compare Datasets](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different data streams.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/) for an example.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/)

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes#

0.236.0 and below

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

![Screenshot of a workflow. The workflow has an Edit Fields node, followed by an If node. It ends with a Merge node.](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-node.png)

## Related resources#

Refer to [Splitting with conditionals](../../../../flow-logic/splitting/) for more information on using conditionals to create complex logic in n8n.

If you need more than two conditional outputs, use the [Switch node](../n8n-nodes-base.switch/).

# Trello Trigger node#

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application which is a subsidiary of Atlassian. Users can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/trello/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Trello Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/trello-trigger/) page.

## Find the Model ID#

The model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.

For this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:

  1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
  2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
  3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
  4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
  5. Copy `idList`and paste it in the **Model ID** field in n8n.

# hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods.md "Edit this page")

# Configuration#

You can change n8n's settings using environment variables. For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](../environment-variables/).

## Set environment variables by command line#

### npm#

For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal using the `export` command as shown below:

    1

|

    export <variable>=<value>

---|---

### Docker#

In Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    docker run -it --rm \
     --name n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED="false" \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

## Set environment variables using a file#

You can also configure n8n using a configuration file.

Only define the values that need to be different from the default in your configuration file. You can use multiple files. For example, you can have a file with generic base settings, and files with specific values for different environments.

### npm#

Set the path to the JSON configuration file using the environment variable `N8N_CONFIG_FILES`:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8

|

    # Bash - Single file
    export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json
    # Bash - Multiple files are comma-separated
    export N8N_CONFIG_FILES=/<path-to-config>/my-config.json,/<path-to-config>/production.json

    # PowerShell - Single file, persist for current user
    # Note that setting scope (Process, User, Machine) has no effect on Unix systems
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('N8N_CONFIG_FILES', '<path-to-config>\config.json', 'User')

---|---

Example file:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    {
     "executions": {
      "saveDataOnSuccess": "none"
     },
     "generic": {
      "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
     },
     "nodes": {
      "exclude": "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\",\"n8n-nodes-base.writeBinaryFile\"]"
     }
    }

---|---

Formatting as JSON

You can't always work out the correct JSON from the [Environment variables reference](../environment-variables/). For example, to set `N8N_METRICS` to `true`, you need to do:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    {
    	"endpoints": {
    		"metrics": {
    			"enable": true
    		}
    	}
    }

---|---

Refer to the [Schema file in the source code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/config/schema.ts) for full details of the expected settings.

### Docker#

In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

For example:

    1
    2
    3

|

    n8n:
        environment:
          - N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false

---|---

### Keeping sensitive data in separate files#

You can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for details on each variable.

While most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) and database configuration. Here are some examples:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12

# Remove Duplicates node#

Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:

  * identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution
  * identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions

This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.

Major changes in 1.64.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).

## Operation modes#

The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:

  * **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** : Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.
  * **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** : Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.
  * **Clear Deduplication History** : Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input#

When you set the "Operations" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** , the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters#

When using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:

  * **Compare** : Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
    * **All Fields** : Compares all fields of the input data.
    * **All Fields Except** : Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
    * **Selected Fields** : Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options#

If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:

  * **Disable Dot Notation** : Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).
  * **Remove Other Fields** : Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions#

When you set the "Operation" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** , the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters#

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:

  * **Keep Items Where** : Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:

    * **Value Is New** : n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.
    * **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value** : n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.
    * **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date** : n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.
  * **Value to Dedupe On** : The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:

    * When using **Value Is New** , this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.
    * When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value** , this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.
    * When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date** , this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options#

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:

  * **Scope** : Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:
    * **Node** : (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can clear the duplication history for this node instance without affecting other nodes.
    * **Workflow** : Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use "workflow" scope. n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to "node" scope independently.

When you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:

  * **History Size** : The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.

### Clear Deduplication History#

When you set the "Operation" field to **Clear Deduplication History** , the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the "Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions" operation uses.

#### Clear Deduplication History parameters#

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:

  * **Mode** : How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:
    * **Clean Database** : Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.

#### Clear Deduplication History options#

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:

  * **Scope** : Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.
    * **Node** : (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.
    * **Workflow** : Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

# integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally.md "Edit this page")

# Run your node locally#

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

  1. Install n8n using npm:

         1

|

         npm install n8n -g

---|---

  2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # In your node directory
         npm run build
         npm link

---|---

  3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
         # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
         npm link <node-package-name>

---|---

Check your directory

Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

     * `~/.n8n/custom/`
     * `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

  4. Start n8n:

         1

|

         n8n start

---|---

  5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

Node names

Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting#

  * There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

You have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    # In ~/.n8n directory run
    mkdir custom
    cd custom
    npm init

# integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookgraph/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookgraph.md "Edit this page")

# Facebook Graph API credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Facebook Graph API](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi/)

Facebook Trigger credentials

If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) node, follow the instructions mentioned in the [Facebook App credentials](../facebookapp/) documentation.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * App access token

## Related resources#

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

  * An app **Access Token**

There are two steps in setting up your credential:

  1. Create a Meta app with the products you need to access.
  2. Generate an App Access Token for that app.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app#

To create a Meta app:

  1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
  2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
  3. Select the **Use case** that aligns with how you wish to use the Facebook Graph API. For example, for products in Meta's **Business** suite (like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Marketing API, App Events, Audience Network, Commerce API, Fundraisers, Jobs, Threat Exchange, and Webhooks), select **Other** , then select **Next**.
  4. Select **Business** and **Next**.
  5. Complete the essential information:
     * Add an **App name**.
     * Add an **App contact email**.
     * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
  6. Select **Create app**.
  7. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
  8. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
  9. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
  10. Select **Save changes**.
  11. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
  12. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
  13. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select the products that make sense for your app and configure them.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token#

Next, create an app access token to use with your n8n credential and the products you selected:

  1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).
  2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.
  3. In **User or Page** , select **Get App Token**.
  4. Select **Generate Access Token**.
  5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

App unavailable

You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.

  6. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

# hosting/configuration/task-runners/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/task-runners.md "Edit this page")

# Task runners#

Task runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript code in the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

This document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them.

## How it works#

The task runner feature consists of three components: a task runner, a task broker, and a task requester.

![Task runner overview](../../../_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)

Task runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.

The runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.

The n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.

## Task runner modes#

You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.

### Internal mode#

In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same `uid` and `gid` as n8n.

### External mode#

In external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n.

![Task runner deployed as a side-car container](../../../_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-external-mode.png)

In this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container. The task runner is fully isolated from the n8n instance.

When using the [Queue mode](../../scaling/queue-mode/), each n8n container (main and workers) needs to have its own task runner.

## Setting up external mode#

Use the following details to configure task runners in external mode

### Configuring n8n instance in external mode#

You can configure n8n to use external task runners by setting the following environment variables:

Environment variables | Description
---|---
`N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` | Enables task runners.
`N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external` | Use task runners in external mode.
`N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker.
`N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` | By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections.

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](../environment-variables/task-runners/).

### Configuring task runners in external mode#

The task runner comes bundled within the n8n Docker image. The Docker image also includes the task runner launcher.

The launcher can start the runner on-demand, which means lower memory usage when there's no work needed, but a short delay (few hundred ms) in cold-start. The launcher also monitors the runner and restarts it in case of infinite loops or other issues.

Run a task runner container from the n8n Docker image by setting the following properties:

Configuration | Description
---|---
`command` | `["/usr/local/bin/task-runner-launcher", "javascript"]`
`livenessProbe` | `GET /healthz`, port `5680`

Set the following environment variables for the container, adjusted to fit your needs:

Environment variables | Description
---|---
`N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker.
`N8N_RUNNERS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5` | The number of concurrent tasks the runner can execute.
`N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679` | The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance.
`N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15` | Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to `0` to disable automatic shutdown.
`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<limit>` | The memory limit for the task runner Node.js process. This should be lower than the limit for container so that the runner runs out of memory before the container. That way, the launcher is able to monitor the runner.
`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` | The [same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance](../environment-variables/timezone-localization/).

For full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](../environment-variables/task-runners/).

# integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes.md "Edit this page")

# Submit community nodes#

Subject to change

The standards described in this document are for the first release of the community nodes repository. These may change in future releases.

Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

  * View the [starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for some examples.
  * Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](../../overview/).
  * Make sure your node follows the standards for community nodes.

## Standards#

To make your node available to the n8n community node repository, you must:

  * Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
  * Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
  * Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute. Refer to the [package.json in the starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/package.json) for an example.
  * Check your node using the [linter](../../test/node-linter/) and test it locally to ensure it works.
  * Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

## Submit your node for verification by n8n#

n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.

Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:

  * Make sure that your node follows the [technical guidelines for verified community nodes](../../build/reference/verification-guidelines/) and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
  * Ensure that your node follows the [UX guidelines](../../build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
  * Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files) or a related public repository.
  * Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.

If your node meets all the above requirements, [click here to submit your node for verification](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b).

Use the GitHub Document Loader node to load data from a GitHub repository for [vector stores](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) or summarization.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the GitHub Document Loader node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/github/). This node doesn't support OAuth for authentication.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Text Splitting** : Choose from:
    * **Simple** : Uses the [Recursive Character Text Splitter](../n8n-nodes-langchain.textsplitterrecursivecharactertextsplitter/) with a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200.
    * **Custom** : Allows you to connect a text splitter of your choice.
  * **Repository Link** : Enter the URL of your GitHub repository.
  * **Branch** : Enter the branch name to use.

## Node options#

  * **Recursive** : Select whether to include sub-folders and files (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Ignore Paths** : Enter directories to ignore.

## Templates and examples#

# integrations/builtin/credentials/woocommerce/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/woocommerce.md "Edit this page")

# WooCommerce credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [WooCommerce](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.woocommerce/)
  * [WooCommerce Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.woocommercetrigger/)

## Prerequisites#

  * Install the [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) plugin on your WordPress website.
  * In WordPress, go to **Settings > Permalinks** and set your WordPress permalinks to use something other than **Plain**.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key

## Related resources#

Refer to [WooCommerce's REST API documentation](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-woocommerce-rest-api/) for more information about the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Consumer Key** : Created when you generate an API key.
  * A **Consumer Secret** : Created when you generate an API key.
  * A **WooCommerce URL**

To generate an API key and set up your credential:

  1. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Rest API > Add key**.
  2. Select **Read/Write** from the **Permissions** dropdown.
  3. Copy the generated **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** and enter them into your n8n credentials.
  4. Enter your WordPress site URL as the **WooCommerce URL**.
  5. By default, n8n passes your credential details in the Authorization header. If you need to pass them as query string parameters instead, turn on **Include Credentials in Query**.

Refer to [Generate Keys](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-woocommerce-rest-api/#3-generate-keys) for more information.

## Resolve "Consumer key is missing" error#

When you try to connect your credentials, you may receive an error like this: `Consumer key is missing`.

This occurs when the server can't parse the Authorization header details when authenticating over SSL.

To resolve it, turn on the **Include Credentials in Query** toggle to pass the consumer key/secret as query string parameters instead and retry the credential.

# Recursive Character Text Splitter node#

The Recursive Character Text Splitter node splits document data recursively to keep all paragraphs, sentences then words together as long as possible.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Recursive Character Text Splitter node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Chunk Size** : Enter the number of characters in each chunk.
  * **Chunk Overlap** : Enter how much overlap to have between chunks.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account.md "Edit this page")

# Google: Service Account#

Using service accounts is more complex than OAuth2. Before you begin:

  * Check if your node is [compatible](../#compatible-nodes) with Service Account.
  * Make sure you need to use Service Account. For most use cases, [OAuth2](../oauth-single-service/) is a better option.
  * Read the Google documentation on [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

## Prerequisites#

  * Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up Service Account#

There are four steps to connecting your n8n credential to a Google Service Account:

  1. Create a Google Cloud Console project.
  2. Enable APIs.
  3. Set up Google Cloud Service Account.
  4. Finish your n8n credential.

### Create a Google Cloud Console project#

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

  1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.
  2. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.
  3. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.
  4. Select **Create**.
  5. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

### Enable APIs#

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.  ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation
  2. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
  3. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.
  4. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

     * Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
     * Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

Google Drive API required

The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

     * Google Docs
     * Google Sheets
     * Google Slides

Google Vertex AI API

In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

  5. Select **ENABLE**.

### Set up Google Cloud Service Account#

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png) Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

  2. Select the hamburger menu **> APIs & Services > Credentials**. Google takes you to your **Credentials** page.

  3. Select **\+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > Service account**.
  4. Enter a name in **Service account name** and an ID in **Service account ID**. Refer to [Creating a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts?hl=en#creating) for more information.
  5. Select **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.
  6. Based on your use-case, you may want to **Select a role** and **Grant users access to this service account** using the corresponding sections.
  7. Select **DONE**.
  8. Select your newly created service account under the **Service Accounts** section. Open the **KEYS** tab.
  9. Select **ADD KEY > Create new key**.
  10. In the modal that appears, select **JSON** , then select **CREATE**. Google saves the file to your computer.

### Finish your n8n credential#

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

  1. Open the downloaded JSON file.
  2. Copy the `client_email` and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Service Account Email**.
  3. Copy the `private_key`. Don't include the surrounding `"` marks. Enter this as the **Private Key** in your n8n credential.

Older versions of n8n

If you're running an n8n version older than 0.156.0, replace all instances of `\n` in the JSON file with new lines.

  4. **Optional** : Choose if you want to [**Impersonate a User**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority) (turned on).

     1. To use this option, you must Enable domain-wide delegation for the service account as a Google Workspace super admin.
     2. Enter the **Email** of the user you want to impersonate.
  5. If you plan to use this credential with the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, turn on **Set up for use in HTTP Request node**.
     1. With this setting turned on, you'll need to add **Scope(s)** for the node. n8n prepopulates some scopes. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for more information.
  6. **Save** your credentials.

## Video#

The following video demonstrates the steps described above.

## Troubleshooting#

### Service Account can't access Google Drive files#

A Service Account can't access Google Drive files and folders that weren't shared with its associated user email.

  1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and copy your Service Account email.
  2. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) and go to the designated file or folder.
  3. Right-click on the file or folder and select **Share**.
  4. Paste your Service Account email into **Add People and groups**.
  5. Select **Editor** for read-write access or **Viewer** for read-only access.

### Enable domain-wide delegation#

To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

Not recommended

Google recommends you [avoid using domain-wide delegation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#domain-wide-delegation), as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk.

To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then:

  1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/), select the hamburger menu, then select **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.
  2. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
  3. Select **Add new**.
  4. In the **Client ID** field, enter the service account's **Client ID**. To get the Client ID:
     * Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.
     * Copy the **OAuth 2 Client ID** and use this as the **Client ID** for the **Domain Wide Delegation**.
  5. In the **OAuth scopes** field, enter a list of comma-separate scopes to grant your application access. For example, if your application needs domain-wide full access to the Google Drive API and the Google Calendar API, enter: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
  6. Select **Authorize**.

It can take from 5 minutes up to 24 hours before you can impersonate all users in your Workspace.

# workflows/tags/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/tags.md "Edit this page")

# Tags#

Workflow tags allow you to label your workflows. You can then filter workflows by tag.

Tags are global. This means when you create a tag, it's available to all users on your n8n instance.

## Add a tag to a workflow#

To add a tag to your workflow:

  1. In your workflow, select **\+ Add tag**.
  2. Select an existing tag, or enter a new tag name.
  3. Once you select a tag and click away from the tag modal, n8n displays the tag next to the workflow name.

You can add more than one tag.

## Filter by tag#

When browsing the workflows on your instance, you can filter by tag.

  1. On the **Workflows** page, select **Filters**.
  2. Select **Tags**.
  3. Select the tag or tags you want to filter by. n8n lists the workflows with that tag.

## Manage tags#

You can edit existing tags. Instance owners can delete tags.

  1. Select **Manage tags**. This is available from **Filters** > **Tags** on the **Workflows** page, or in the **\+ Add tag** modal in your workflow.
  2. Hover over the tag you want to change.
  3. Select **Edit** ![Add node icon](../../_images/common-icons/edit.png) to rename it, or **Delete** ![Add node icon](../../_images/common-icons/delete.png) to delete it.

Global tags

Tags are global. If you edit or delete a tag, this affects all users of your n8n instance.

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node.md "Edit this page")

# Build a programmatic-style node#

This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites#

You need the following installed on your development machine:

  * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

  * JavaScript/TypeScript
  * REST APIs
  * git
  * [Expressions](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) in n8n

## Build your node#

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.

Existing node

n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project#

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

  1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.
  2. Clone your new repository:

         1
         2

|

         git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid
         cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid

---|---

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

  * `nodes/ExampleNode`
  * `nodes/HTTPBin`
  * `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
  * `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/FriendGrid`
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`
`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

    1

|

    npm i

---|---

### Step 2: Add an icon#

Save the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg) as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Define the node in the base file#

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](../reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports#

Start by adding the import statements:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14

|

    import {
    	IExecuteFunctions,
    } from 'n8n-core';

    import {
    	IDataObject,
    	INodeExecutionData,
    	INodeType,
    	INodeTypeDescription,
    } from 'n8n-workflow';

    import {
    	OptionsWithUri,
    } from 'request';

---|---

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class#

The node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
    	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    		// Basic node details will go here
    		properties: [
    			// Resources and operations will go here
    		],
    	};
    	// The execute method will go here
    	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    	}
    }

---|---

#### Step 3.3: Add node details#

All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17

|

    displayName: 'FriendGrid',
    name: 'friendGrid',
    icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg',
    group: ['transform'],
    version: 1,
    description: 'Consume SendGrid API',
    defaults: {
    	name: 'FriendGrid',
    },
    inputs: ['main'],
    outputs: ['main'],
    credentials: [
    	{
    		name: 'friendGridApi',
    		required: true,
    	},
    ],

---|---

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.

#### Step 3.4: Add the resource#

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15

|

    {
    	displayName: 'Resource',
    	name: 'resource',
    	type: 'options',
    	options: [
    		{
    			name: 'Contact',
    			value: 'contact',
    		},
    	],
    	default: 'contact',
    	noDataExpression: true,
    	required: true,
    	description: 'Create a new contact',
    },

---|---

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations#

The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7

    {
    	displayName: 'Operation',
    	name: 'operation',
    	type: 'options',
    	displayOptions: {
    		show: {
    			resource: [
    				'contact',
    			],
    		},
    	},
    	options: [
    		{
    			name: 'Create',
    			value: 'create',
    			description: 'Create a contact',
    			action: 'Create a contact',
    		},
    	],
    	default: 'create',
    	noDataExpression: true,
    },
    {
    	displayName: 'Email',
    	name: 'email',
    	type: 'string',
    	required: true,
    	displayOptions: {
    		show: {
    			operation: [
    				'create',
    			],
    			resource: [
    				'contact',
    			],
    		},
    	},
    	default:'',
    	placeholder: 'name@email.com',
    	description:'Primary email for the contact',
    },

---|---

#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields#

Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13

    31

|

    {
    	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
    	name: 'additionalFields',
    	type: 'collection',
    	placeholder: 'Add Field',
    	default: {},
    	displayOptions: {
    		show: {
    			resource: [
    				'contact',
    			],
    			operation: [
    				'create',
    			],
    		},
    	},
    	options: [
    		{
    			displayName: 'First Name',
    			name: 'firstName',
    			type: 'string',
    			default: '',
    		},
    		{
    			displayName: 'Last Name',
    			name: 'lastName',
    			type: 'string',
    			default: '',
    		},
    	],
    },

---|---

### Step 4: Add the execute method#

You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.

The `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.

Add the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6

    // Handle data coming from previous nodes
    const items = this.getInputData();
    let responseData;
    const returnData = [];
    const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string;
    const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;

    // For each item, make an API call to create a contact
    for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    	if (resource === 'contact') {
    		if (operation === 'create') {
    			// Get email input
    			const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
    			// Get additional fields input
    			const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject;
    			const data: IDataObject = {
    				email,
    			};

    			Object.assign(data, additionalFields);

    			// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/
    			const options: OptionsWithUri = {
    				headers: {
    					'Accept': 'application/json',
    				},
    				method: 'PUT',
    				body: {
    					contacts: [
    						data,
    					],
    				},
    				uri: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`,
    				json: true,
    			};
    			responseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options);
    			returnData.push(responseData);
    		}
    	}
    }
    // Map data to n8n data structure
    return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];

---|---

Note the following lines of this code:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    const items = this.getInputData();
    ...
    for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    	...
    	const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string;
    	...
    }

---|---

Users can provide data in two ways:

  * Entered directly in the node fields
  * By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow

`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.

### Step 5: Set up authentication#

The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5

    import {
    	IAuthenticateGeneric,
    	ICredentialTestRequest,
    	ICredentialType,
    	INodeProperties,
    } from 'n8n-workflow';

    export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType {
    	name = 'friendGridApi';
    	displayName = 'FriendGrid API';
    	properties: INodeProperties[] = [
    		{
    			displayName: 'API Key',
    			name: 'apiKey',
    			type: 'string',
    			default: '',
    		},
    	];

    	authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = {
    		type: 'generic',
    		properties: {
    			headers: {
    				Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}',
    			},
    		},
    	};

    	test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
    		request: {
    			baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3',
    			url: '/marketing/contacts',
    		},
    	};
    }

---|---

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](../reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 6: Add node metadata#

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Test your node#

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

  1. Install n8n using npm:

         1

|

         npm install n8n -g

---|---

  2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # In your node directory
         npm run build
         npm link

---|---

  3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
         # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
         npm link <node-package-name>

---|---

Check your directory

Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

     * `~/.n8n/custom/`
     * `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

  4. Start n8n:

         1

|

         n8n start

---|---

  5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

Node names

Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting#

  * There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

You have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    # In ~/.n8n directory run
    mkdir custom
    cd custom
    npm init

---|---

## Next steps#

  * [Deploy your node](../../deploy/).
  * View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost). This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure.
  * Learn about [node versioning](../reference/node-versioning/).
  * Make sure you understand key concepts: [item linking](../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) and [data structures](../../../../data/data-structure/).

# workflows/create/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/create.md "Edit this page")

# Create a workflow#

A [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the [workflow canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n).

## Create a workflow#

  1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](../../_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
  2. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
  3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

Or:

  1. Select the ![universal create resource icon](../../_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.
  2. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
  3. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](../../try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

## Run workflows manually#

You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.

To run manually, select **Test Workflow**.

## Run workflows automatically#

All new workflows are inactive by default.

You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.

To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle **Inactive** / **Active**.

Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatollama/index.md "Edit this page")

# Ollama Chat Model node#

The Ollama Chat Model node allows you use local Llama 2 models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Ollama Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/ollama/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from:
    * **Llama2**
    * **Llama2 13B**
    * **Llama2 70B**
    * **Llama2 Uncensored**

Refer to the Ollama [Models Library documentation](https://ollama.com/library) for more information about available models.

## Node options#

  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
  * **Top K** : Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
  * **Top P** : Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/index.md "Edit this page")

# Google credentials#

This section contains:

  * [OAuth2 single service](oauth-single-service/): Create an OAuth2 credential for a specific service node, such as the Gmail node.
  * [OAuth2 generic](oauth-generic/): Create an OAuth2 credential for use with [custom operations](../../../custom-operations/).
  * [Service Account](service-account/): Create a [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) credential for some specific service nodes.
  * [Google PaLM and Gemini](../googleai/): Get a Google Gemini/Google PaLM API key.

## OAuth2 and Service Account#

There are two authentication methods available for Google services nodes:

  * [OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2): Recommended because it's more widely available and easier to set up.
  * [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts): Refer to the [Google documentation: Understanding service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) for guidance on when you need a service account.

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

  * [Google Calendar](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
  * [Google Contacts](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)
  * [Google Drive](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/)
  * [Google Mail](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)
  * [Google Sheets](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)

Gmail and Service Accounts

Google technically supports Service Accounts for use with Gmail, but it requires enabling domain-wide delegation, which Google discourages, and its behavior can be inconsistent.

n8n recommends using OAuth2 with the Gmail node.

  1. Visit the page in your Notion workspace.
  2. Select the triple dot menu at the top right of a page.
  3. In **Connections** , select **Connect to**.
  4. Use the search bar to find and select your integration from the dropdown list.

Once you share at least one page with the integration, you can start making API requests. If the page isn't shared, any API requests made will respond with an error.

Refer to [Integration permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#integration-permissions) for more information.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID** : Generated once you configure a public integration.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated once you configure a public integration.

You must [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion) and set it to public distribution:

  1. Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
  2. Select the **\+ New integration** button.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your integration, for example `n8n integration`. If desired, add a **Logo**.
  4. Select **Submit** to create your integration.
  5. Open the **Capabilities** tab. Select these capabilities:
     * `Read content`
     * `Update content`
     * `Insert content`
     * `User information without email addresses`
  6. Select **Save changes**.
  7. Go to the **Distribution** tab.
  8. Turn on the **Do you want to make this integration public?** control.
  9. Enter your company name and website in the **Organization Information** section.
  10. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it to as a **Redirect URI** in the Notion integration's **OAuth Domain & URLs** section.
  11. Go to the **Secrets** tab.
  12. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Internal vs. public integrations#

**Internal** integrations are:

  * Specific to a single workspace.
  * Accessible only to members of that workspace.
  * Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.

Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

  * Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
  * Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
  * Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.

For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations).

# integrations/builtin/credentials/nextcloud/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/nextcloud.md "Edit this page")

# Nextcloud credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Nextcloud](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nextcloud/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Basic auth
  * OAuth2

## Related resources#

Refer to [Nextcloud's API documentation](https://nextcloud-server.netlify.app/) for more information about the service.

Refer to [Nextcloud's user manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/contents.html) for more information on installing and configuring Nextcloud.

## Using basic auth#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) account and:

  * Your **Web DAV URL**
  * Your **User** name
  * Your **Password** or an app password

To set it up:

  1. To create your **Web DAV URL** : If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain: Enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.
     * If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.
     * Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.
  2. Enter your **User** name.
  3. For the **Password** , Nextcloud recommends using an app password rather than your user password. To create an app password:
     1. In the Nextcloud Web interface, select your avatar in the top right and select **Personal settings**.
     2. In the left menu, choose **Security**.
     3. Scroll to the bottom to the **App Password** section and create a new app password.
     4. Copy that app password and enter it in n8n as your **Password**.

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) account and:

  * An **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** : These depend on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.
  * A **Client ID** : Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in **Administrator Security Settings**.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in **Administrator Security Settings**.
  * A **Web DAV URL** : This depends on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.

To set it up:

  1. In Nextcloud, open your **Administrator Security Settings**.
  2. Find the **Add client** section under **OAuth 2.0 clients**.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your client, like `n8n integration`.
  4. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirection URI**.
  5. Then select **Add** in Nextcloud.
  6. In n8n, update the **Authorization URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Authorization URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/authorize`.
  7. In n8n, update the **Access Token URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Access Token URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.

Pretty URL configuration

The **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** assume that you've configured Nextcloud to use [Pretty URLs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls). If you haven't, you must add `/index.php/` between your Nextcloud URL and the `/apps/oauth2` portion, for example: `https://cloud.n8n.com/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.

  8. Copy the Nextcloud **Client Identifier** for your OAuth2 client and enter it as the **Client ID** in n8n.

  9. Copy the Nextcloud **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in n8n.
  10. In n8n, to create your **Web DAV URL** : If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.
     * If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.
     * Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.

Refer to the Nextcloud [OAuth2 Configuration documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/oauth2.html) for more detailed instructions.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes.md "Edit this page")

# Nodes environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists the environment variables configuration options for managing [nodes](../../../../glossary/#node-n8n) in n8n, including specifying which nodes to load or exclude, importing built-in or external modules in the Code node, and enabling community nodes.

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`NODES_INCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes to load.
`NODES_EXCLUDE` | Array of strings | - | Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: `NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"`
`NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` | String | - | Permit users to import specific built-in modules in the Code node. Use * to allow all. n8n disables importing modules by default.
`NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` | String | - | Permit users to import specific external modules (from `n8n/node_modules`) in the Code node. n8n disables importing modules by default.
`NODES_ERROR_TRIGGER_TYPE` | String | `n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger` | Specify which node type to use as Error Trigger.
`N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS` | String | - | Specify the path to directories containing your custom nodes.
`N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | Enables (true) or disables (false) the functionality to install and load community nodes. If set to false, neither verified nor unverified community packages will be available, regardless of their individual settings.
`N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_REGISTRY` | String | `https://registry.npmjs.org` | NPM registry URL to pull community packages from (license required).
`N8N_VERIFIED_PACKAGES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | When `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` is true, this variable controls whether to show verified community nodes in the nodes panel for installation and use (true) or to hide them (false).
`N8N_UNVERIFIED_PACKAGES_ENABLED` | Boolean | `true` | When `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` is true, this variable controls whether to enable the installation and use of unverified community nodes from an NPM registry (true) or not (false).
`N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_PREVENT_LOADING` | Boolean | `false` | Prevents (true) or allows (false) loading installed community nodes on instance startup. Use this if a faulty node prevents the instance from starting.

# user-management/rbac/role-types/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/rbac/role-types.md "Edit this page")

# RBAC role types#

Feature availability

  * The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
  * The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.

Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.

## Project Admin#

A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:

  * Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
  * Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
  * View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

## Project Editor#

A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

## Project Viewer#

A Project Viewer is effectively a `read-only` role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.

Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](../projects/).

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set.md "Edit this page")

# Edit Fields (Set)#

Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.

## Node parameters#

These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.

### Mode#

You can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.

### Fields to Set#

If you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping** , you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.

The default behavior when you drag a value is:

  * n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
  * The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.

If you don't want to use expressions:

  1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle.
  2. Select **Fixed**.

You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

![A gif showing the drag and drop action, as well as changing a field to fixed](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/set/drag-drop-fixed-toggle.gif)

### Keep Only Set Fields#

Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.

### Include in Output#

Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.

## Node options#

Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.

### Include Binary Data#

If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.

### Ignore Type Conversion Errors#

Manual Mapping only.

Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.

### Support Dot Notation#

By default, n8n supports dot notation.

For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:

    1

|

    { "number": { "one": 20} }

---|---

You can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation** , and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:

    1

|

    { "number.one": 20 }

---|---

# Date and time with Luxon#

[Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.

Python support

Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience variables created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:

  * You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.
  * The generic Luxon functionality, such as Convert date string to Luxon, isn't available for Python users.

## Variables#

n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:

  * `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.
  * `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.

Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's `DateTime.now()`.

    # n8n displays "Today's date is <unix timestamp>"
    # For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"

---|---

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

## Date and time behavior in n8n#

Be aware of the following:

  * In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.
  * With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

## Setting the timezone in n8n#

Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:

  * Default: `America/New York`
  * A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.
  * A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.

## Common tasks#

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).

### Convert date string to Luxon#

You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.

A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date

With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:#

Most dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

    1

|

    {{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}

---|---

    1

|

    let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')

---|---

Luxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso).

Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.

#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:#

Use Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.

For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

    1

|

    {{DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")}}

---|---

    1

|

    let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")

---|---

When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations). If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging) guide.

### Get n days from today#

Get a number of days before or after today.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.

In the expressions editor, enter:

    1

|

    {{$today.minus({days: 7})}}

---|---

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.

In the code editor, enter:

    1

|

    let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})

---|---

On the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: "2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00"]`.

This example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.

For more detailed information and examples, refer to:

  * Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)
  * Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)

### Create human-readable dates#

In Get n days from today, the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: "yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00"]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.

For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.

This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

    1

|

    {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}

---|---

    1

|

    let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()

---|---

You can alter the format. For example:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

    1

|

    {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}

---|---

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".

    1

|

    let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})

---|---

On 23rd June 2019, this returns "16 June 2019".

Refer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans) for more information.

### Get the time between two dates#

To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.

For example, get the number of months between two dates:

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

    1

|

    {{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}

---|---

This returns `[Object: {"months":1}]`.

    1

|

    let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()

---|---

This returns `{"months":1}`.

Refer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs) for more information.

### A longer example: How many days to Christmas?#

This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.

The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.

Expressions (JavaScript)Code node (JavaScript)

    1

|

    {{"There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!"}}

---|---

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the expression does:

  * `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.
  * `"There are "`: a string.
  * `+`: used to join two strings.
  * `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in Get the time between two dates, but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
  * `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
  * `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {"days":-291}]`.
  * `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](../jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
  * `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
  * `+ " days to Christmas!"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.
  * `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.

    1

|

    let daysToChristmas = "There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!";

---|---

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the code does:

  * `"There are "`: a string.
  * `+`: used to join two strings.

# data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors.md "Edit this page")

# Item linking errors#

In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`.

![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](../../../../_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)

Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.

Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.

`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.

When using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:

  * The thread is broken
  * The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)

To solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.

You can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.

The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.

### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'#

If you see this error message:

> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node

There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:

  * Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](../item-linking-code-node/) for more information.
  * Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/) for more information.

### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'#

This is the error message:

> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression

Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.

When you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:

  * Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.
  * Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.

# hosting/securing/telemetry-opt-out/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/securing/telemetry-opt-out.md "Edit this page")

# Data collection#

n8n collects some anonymous data from self-hosted n8n installations. Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.

## Collected data#

Refer to [Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n](../../../privacy-security/privacy/#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n) for details on the data n8n collects.

## How collection works#

Your n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.

## Opting out of data collection#

n8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.

### Opt out of telemetry events#

To opt out of telemetry events, set the `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

    1

|

    export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false

---|---

### Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n#

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the `N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

    1

|

    export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false

---|---

## Disable all connection to n8n servers#

If you want to fully prevent all communication with n8n's servers, refer to [Isolate n8n](../../configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

## Related resources#

Refer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these environment variables.

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

# Node base file#

The node base file contains the core code of your node. All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/).

These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](../../declarative-style-node/) or [Build a programmatic-style node](../../programmatic-style-node/).

You can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.

For all nodes, refer to the:

  * [Structure of the node base file](structure/)
  * [Standard parameters](standard-parameters/)

For declarative-style nodes, refer to the:

  * [Declarative-style parameters](declarative-style-parameters/)

For programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:

  * [Programmatic-style parameters](programmatic-style-parameters/)
  * [Programmatic-style execute() method](programmatic-style-execute-method/)

# integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/common-issues/index.md

# Postgres node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters#

In Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:

    1

|

    SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');

---|---

While you can use n8n [expressions](../../../../../code/expressions/) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](../#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.

To construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:

  1. Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.
  2. In **Options** , select **Query Parameters**.
  3. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.
  4. In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:

         1

|

         SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();

---|---

  5. Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:

         1

|

         SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => "$" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});

---|---

With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.

## Working with timestamps and time zones#

To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:

  * **Use UTC when storing and passing dates** : Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
  * **Set the execution timezone** : Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](../../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](../../../../../workflows/settings/).
  * **Use ISO 8601 format** : The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](../../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror.md "Edit this page")

# Stop And Error#

Use the Stop And Error node to display custom error messages, cause executions to fail under certain conditions, and send custom error information to error workflows.

## Operations#

  * Error Message
  * Error Object

## Node parameters#

Both operations include one node parameter, the **Error Type**. Use this parameter to select the type of error to throw. Choose between the two operations: **Error Message** and **Error Object**.

The other parameters depend on which operation you select.

### Error Message parameters#

The Error Message Error Type adds one parameter, the **Error Message** field. Enter the message you'd like to throw.

### Error Object parameters#

The Error Object Error Type adds one parameter, the **Error Object**. Enter a JSON object that contains the error properties you'd like to throw.

# Wikipedia node#

The Wikipedia node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to search and return information from Wikipedia.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

# integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Notion node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Notion node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Relation property not displaying#

The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.

To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on [name of related database]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.

If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:

    1

|

    https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>

---|---

Enable **Send Body** , set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON** , and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    {
    	"properties": {
    		"Account": {
    			"relation": [
    				{
    					"id": "<your_relation_ID>"
    				}
    			]
    		}
    	}
    }

---|---

## Create toggle heading#

The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to **Page** , **Database Page** , or **Block** resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.

You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):

  1. Add a heading with Notion node.
  2. Select the resource you want to add a heading to:
     * To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.
     * To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.
  3. Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1** , **Heading 2** , or **Heading 3**.
  4. Add an [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.
  5. Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.
  6. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
  7. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node after the HTTP Request node.
  8. Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.
  9. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.
  10. Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.
  11. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
  12. Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.
  13. Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).
  14. Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).

The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block.

## Handle null and empty values#

You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.

To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.

To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an [If](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.

As an alternative, you can set a [default value](../../../../../code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) if the incoming data doesn't provide one.

# data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui.md "Edit this page")

# Mapping in the UI#

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.

You can map data in the following ways:

  * Using the expressions editor.
  * By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](../data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## How to drag and drop data#

  1. Run your workflow to load data.
  2. Open the node where you need to map data.
  3. You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:
     * In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.
     * In JSON view: click and hold a key.
     * In schema view: click and hold a key.
  4. Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.

### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop#

Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

    		"color": "green"
    	}
    ]

---|---

You can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.

### Understand nested data#

Given the following data:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16

|

    [
      {
        "name": "First item",
        "nested": {
          "example-number-field": 1,
          "example-string-field": "apples"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "Second item",
        "nested": {
          "example-number-field": 2,
          "example-string-field": "oranges"
        }
      }
    ]

---|---

n8n displays it in table form like this:

!["Screenshot of a table in the INPUT panel. It includes a top level field named "nested." This field contains nested data, which is indicated in bold."](../../../_images/data/data-mapping/nested-data.png)

# Cluster nodes#

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](../../../_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)

## Root nodes#

Each cluster starts with one [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n).

## Sub-nodes#

Each root node can have one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) attached to it.

# HTML#

The HTML node provides operations to help you work with HTML in n8n.

HTML Extract node

The HTML node replaces the HTML Extract node from version 0.213.0 on. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [HTML Extract node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/86fe33b681621e618e3adcab9a27e8605dbc23ad/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.htmlextract.md).

Cross-site scripting

When using the HTML node to generate an HTML template you can introduce [XSS (cross-site scripting)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/). This is a security risk. Be careful with un-trusted inputs.

## Operations#

  * **Generate HTML template**: Use this operation to create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.
  * **Extract HTML content**: Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).
  * **Convert to HTML Table**: Convert content to an HTML table.

The node parameters and options depend on the operation you select. Refer to the sections below for more details on configuring each operation.

## Generate HTML template#

Create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.

You can include:

  * Standard HTML
  * CSS in `<style>` tags.
  * JavaScript in `<script>` tags. n8n doesn't execute the JavaScript.
  * Expressions, wrapped in `{{}}`.

You can use [Expressions](../../../../code/expressions/) in the template, including n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/).

## Extract HTML Content#

Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).

Use these parameters:

### Source Data#

Select the source type for your HTML content. Choose between:

  * **JSON** : If you select this source data, enter the **JSON Property** : the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.
  * **Binary** : If you select this source data, enter the **Input Binary Field** : the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.

### Extraction Values#

  * **Key** : Enter the key to save the extracted value under.
  * **CSS Selector** : Enter the CSS selector to search for.
  * **Return Value** : Select the type of data to return. Choose from:
    * **Attribute** : Return an attribute value like `class` from an element.
      * If you select this option, enter the name of the **Attribute** to return the value of.
    * **HTML** : Return the HTML that the element contains.
    * **Text** : Return the text content of the element.
      * If you choose this option, you can also enter a comma-separated list of selectors to skip in the **Skip Selectors**.
    * **Value** : Return the value of an input, select, or text area.
  * **Return Array** : Choose whether to return multiple extraction values as an array (turned on) or as a single string (turned off).

### Extract HTML Content options#

You can also configure this operation with these options:

  * **Trim Values** : Controls whether to remove all spaces and newlines from the beginning and end of the values (turned on) or leaves them (turned off).
  * **Clean Up Text** : Controls whether to remove leading whitespaces, trailing whitespaces, and line breaks (newlines) and condense multiple consecutive whitespaces into a single space (turned on) or to leave them as-is (turned off).

## Convert to HTML Table#

This operation expects data from another node. It has no parameters. It includes these options:

  * **Capitalize Headers** : Controls whether to capitalize the table's headers (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Custom Styling** : Controls whether to use custom styling (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Caption** : Enter a caption to add to the table.
  * **Table Attributes** : Enter any attributes to apply to the `<table>`, such as style attributes.
  * **Header Attributes** : Enter any attributes to apply to the table's headers `<th>`.
  * **Row Attributes** : Enter any attributes to apply to the table's rows `<tr>`.
  * **Cell Attributes** : Enter any attributes to apply to the table's cells `<td>`.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.s3.md "Edit this page")

# S3 node#

Use the S3 node to automate work in non-AWS S3 storage and integrate S3 with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of S3 features, including creating, deleting, and getting buckets, files, and folders. For AWS S3, use [AWS S3](../n8n-nodes-base.awss3/).

Use the S3 node for non-AWS S3 solutions like:

  * [MinIO](https://min.io/)
  * [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)
  * [Digital Ocean spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the S3 node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [S3 credentials](../../credentials/s3/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Operations#

  * Bucket
    * Create a bucket
    * Delete a bucket
    * Get all buckets
    * Search within a bucket
  * File

    * Copy a file
    * Delete a file
    * Download a file
    * Get all files
    * Upload a file

Attach file for upload

To attach a file for upload, use another node to pass the file as a data property. Nodes like the [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) work well.

  * Folder

    * Create a folder
    * Delete a folder
    * Get all folders

# integrations/builtin/credentials/dropbox/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/dropbox.md "Edit this page")

# Dropbox credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Dropbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token: Dropbox recommends this method for testing with your user account and granting a limited number of users access.
  * OAuth2: Dropbox recommends this method for production or for testing with more than 50 users.

App reuse

You can transition an app from the API access token to OAuth2 by creating a new credential in n8n for OAuth2 using the same app.

## Related resources#

Refer to [Dropbox's Developer documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation) for more information about the service.

## Using access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) developer account and:

  * An **Access Token** : Generated once you create a Dropbox app.
  * An **App Access Type**

To set up the credential, create a Dropbox app:

  1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.
  2. Select **Create app**.
  3. In **Choose an API** , select **Scoped access**.
  4. In **Choose the type of access you need** , choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/) node:
     * **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
     * **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
     * Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.
  5. In **Name your app** , enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
  6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
  7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
  8. In the **OAuth 2** section, in **Generated access token** , select **Generate**.
  9. Copy the access token and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
  10. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the [Dropbox App Console Settings documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started) for more information.

User limits

On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app, even with the access token method. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Cloud users need to select the **App Access Type** :

  * **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
  * **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
  * Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 manually:

  1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.
  2. Select **Create app**.
  3. In **Choose an API** , select **Scoped access**.
  4. In **Choose the type of access you need** , choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/) node:
     * **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
     * **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
     * Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.
  5. In **Name your app** , enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
  6. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
  7. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
  8. Copy the **App key** and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.
  9. Copy the **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in your n8n credential.
  10. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it in the Dropbox **Redirect URIs**.
  11. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the instructions in the [Dropbox Implementing OAuth documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#implementing-oauth) for more information.

For internal tools and limited usage, you can keep your app private. But if you'd like your app to be used by more than 50 users or you want to distribute it, you'll need to complete Dropbox's production approval process. Refer to **Production Approval** in the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.

User limits

On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md "Edit this page")

# Merge#

Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.

Major changes in 0.194.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md).

Minor changes in 1.49.0

n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.

## Node parameters#

You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode** :

### Append#

Keep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs.

![Sample Append mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left, one with items A, B, C and one with items D, E, F. The final data source combines both and lists A, B, C, D, E, F.](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/append-diagram.png) Append mode inputs and output

### Combine#

Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.

#### Matching Fields#

Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**.

n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:

  * **Keep Matches** : Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
  * **Keep Non-Matches** : Merge items that don't match.
  * **Keep Everything** : Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
  * **Enrich Input 1** : Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
  * **Enrich Input 2** : Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.

![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by matching fields.](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-field-diagram.png) Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output

#### Position#

Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.

![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by index position.](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-position-diagram.png) Combine by Position mode inputs and output

#### All Possible Combinations#

Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.

![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by all possible combinations.](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/multiplex-diagram.png) Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output

#### Combine mode options#

When merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options** :

  * **Clash Handling** : Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to Clash handling for details.
  * **Fuzzy Compare** : Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `"3"` and `3` as the same.
  * **Disable Dot Notation** : This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.
  * **Multiple Matches** : Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
    * **Include All Matches** : Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
    * **Include First Match Only** : Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
  * **Include Any Unpaired Items** : Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.

##### Clash Handling#

If multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named `language`, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if `language` has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items.

You can change this behavior by selecting **Options** > **Clash Handling** :

  * **When Field Values Clash** : Choose which input to prioritize, or choose **Always Add Input Number to Field Names** to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from.
  * **Merging Nested Fields**
    * **Deep Merge** : Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties.
    * **Shallow Merge** : Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties.

### SQL Query#

Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data.

Example:

    1

|

    SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id

---|---

Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements) for a full list of supported SQL statements.

### Choose Branch#

Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output** :

  * The **Input 1 Data**
  * The **Input 2 Data**
  * **A Single, Empty Item**

The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items#

The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes#

0.236.0 and below

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

![Screenshot of a workflow. The workflow has an Edit Fields node, followed by an If node. It ends with a Merge node.](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-node.png)

## Try it out: A step by step example#

### Try out different merge modes#

Add the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1** , and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.

The final workflow should look like this:

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/655-merge-greetings-with-the-users-based-on-the-language/)

Now try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.

#### Append#

Select **Mode** > **Append** , then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

**name** | **language** | **greeting**
---|---|---
Stefan | de |
Jim | en |
Hans | de |
| en | Hello
| de | Hallo

#### Combine by Matching Fields#

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.

  1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.
  2. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.
  3. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field** , enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.
  4. Select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

**name** | **language** | **greeting**
---|---|---
Stefan | de | Hallo
Jim | en | Hello
Hans | de | Hallo

#### Combine by Position#

Select **Mode** > **Combine** , **Combine by** > **Position** , then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

**name** | **language** | **greeting**
---|---|---
Stefan | en | Hello
Jim | de | Hallo

##### Keep unpaired items#

If you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items** , then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

**name** | **language** | **greeting**
---|---|---
Stefan | en | Hello
Jim | de | Hallo
Hans | de |

#### Combine by All Possible Combinations#

Select **Mode** > **Combine** , **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations** , then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

**name** | **language** | **greeting**
---|---|---
Stefan | en | Hello
Stefan | de | Hallo
Jim | en | Hello
Jim | de | Hallo
Hans | en | Hello
Hans | de | Hallo

# Slack Trigger node#

Use the Slack Trigger node to respond to events in [Slack](https://slack.com/) and integrate Slack with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Slack events, including new messages, reactions, and new channels.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Slack Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/slack/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Slack integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack-trigger/) page.

## Events#

  * **Any Event** : The node triggers on any event in Slack.
  * **Bot / App Mention** : The node triggers when your bot or app is [mentioned](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack) in a channel the app is in.
  * **File Made Public** : The node triggers when a file is [made public](https://slack.com/help/articles/4412651915539-Manage-public-file-sharing).
  * **File Shared** : The node triggers when a file is [shared](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330736-Add-files-to-Slack) in a channel the app is in.
  * **New Message Posted to Channel** : The node triggers when a new message is posted to a channel the app is in.
  * **New Public Channel Created** : The node triggers when a new [public channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel) is created.
  * **New User** : The node triggers when a new user is added to Slack.
  * **Reaction Added** : The node triggers when a [reaction](https://slack.com/help/articles/202931348-Use-emoji-and-reactions) is added to a message the app is added to.

## Parameters#

Once you've set the events to trigger on, use the remaining parameters to further define the node's behavior:

  * **Watch Whole Workspace** : Whether the node should watch for the selected **Events** in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default).

Caution

This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution!

  * **Channel to Watch** : Select the channel your node should watch for the selected **Events**. This parameter only appears if you don't turn on **Watch Whole Workspace**. You can select a channel:

    * **From list** : The node uses your credential to look up a list of channels in the workspace so you can select the channel you want.
    * **By ID** : Enter the ID of a channel you want to watch. Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button.
    * **By URL** : Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as `https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address>`.
  * **Download Files** : Whether to download files and use them in the node's output (turned on) or not (turned off, default). Use this parameter with the **File Made Public** and **File Shared** events.

## Options#

You can further refine the node's behavior when you **Add Option** s:

  * **Resolve IDs** : Whether to resolve the IDs to their respective names and return them (turned on) or not (turned off, default).
  * **Usernames or IDs to ignore** : Select usernames or enter a comma-separated string of encoded user IDs to ignore events from. Choose from the list, or specify IDs using an [expression](../../../../code/expressions/).

## Related resources#

n8n provides an app node for Slack. You can find the node docs [here](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/).

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack-trigger/) on n8n's website.

Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for details about their API.

## Required scopes#

To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.

You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.

The node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list) methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](../../credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.

## Common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production#

Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

  1. Go to your workflow page.
  2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
  3. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
  4. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
  5. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
  6. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

### Token expired#

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

# data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node.md "Edit this page")

# Item linking in the Code node#

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/). This document focuses on practical usage examples.

When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$("<node-name>").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.

These scenarios are when you:

  * Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.
  * Return new items.
  * Want to manually control the item linking.

[n8n's automatic item linking](../item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.

To control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9

|

    [
    	{
    		"json": {
    			. . .
    		},
    		// The index of the input item that generated this output item
    		"pairedItem": 0
    	}
    ]

---|---

### `pairedItem` usage example#

Take this input data:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14

    20
    21

    [
      {
        "id": "23423532",
        "name": "Jay Gatsby"
      },
      {
        "id": "23423533",
        "name": "José Arcadio Buendía"
      },
      {
        "id": "23423534",
        "name": "Max Sendak"
      },
      {
        "id": "23423535",
        "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox"
      },
      {
        "id": "23423536",
        "name": "Edmund Pevensie"
      }
    ]

---|---

And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14

|

    newItems = [];
    for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
      newItems.push(
        {
        "json":
          {
            "name": items[i].json.name,
    				"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
          }
        }
      )
    }

    return newItems;

---|---

`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.

Add the `pairedItem` object:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14

|

    newItems = [];
    for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
      newItems.push(
        {
          "json":

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/index.md "Edit this page")

# Webhook node#

Use the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.

You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.

The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.

## Workflow development process#

n8n provides different **Webhook URL** s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](workflow-development/) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.

## Node parameters#

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### Webhook URLs#

The Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs** : test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

![Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab display a Test URL and Production URL](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-urls.png) Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab

  * **Test** : n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow** , if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
  * **Production** : n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

### HTTP Method#

The Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):

  * DELETE
  * GET
  * HEAD
  * PATCH
  * POST
  * PUT

Webhook max payload

The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.

### Path#

By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

  * `/:variable`
  * `/path/:variable`
  * `/:variable/path`
  * `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
  * `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Supported authentication methods#

You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

  * Basic auth
  * Header auth
  * JWT auth
  * None

Refer to [Webhook credentials](../../credentials/webhook/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Respond#

  * **Immediately** : The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.
  * **When Last Node Finishes** : The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
  * **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node** : The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

### Response Code#

Customize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.

### Response Data#

Choose what data to include in the response body:

  * **All Entries** : The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
  * **First Entry JSON** : The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
  * **First Entry Binary** : The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
  * **No Response Body** : The Webhook returns without a body.

Applies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.

## Node options#

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.

  * **Allowed Origins (CORS)** : Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.
  * **Binary Property** : Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
  * **Ignore Bots** : Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
  * **IP(s) Whitelist** : Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IP addresses outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
  * **No Response Body** : Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
  * **Raw Body** : Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
  * **Response Content-Type** : Choose the format for the webhook body.
  * **Response Data** : Send custom data with the response.
  * **Response Headers** : Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
  * **Property Name** : by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.

Option | Required node configuration
---|---
Allowed Origins (CORS) | Any
Binary Property | Either:
HTTP Method > POST
HTTP Method > PATCH
HTTP Method > PUT
Ignore Bots | Any
IP(s) Whitelist | Any
Property Name | Both:
Respond > When Last Node Finishes
Response Data > First Entry JSON
No Response Body | Respond > Immediately
Raw Body | Any
Response Code | Any except Respond > Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node
Response Content-Type | Both:
Respond > When Last Node Finishes
Response Data > First Entry JSON
Response Data | Respond > Immediately
Response Headers | Any

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files.md "Edit this page")

# Node codex files#

The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json) file in the n8n starter.

The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex would be named `MyNode.node.json`.

Parameter | Description
---|---
`node` | Includes the node name. Must start with `n8n-nodes-base.`. For example, `n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi`.
`nodeVersion` | The node version. This should have the same value as the `version` parameter in your main node file. For example, `"1.0"`.
`codexVersion` | The codex file version. The current version is `"1.0"`.
`categories` | The settings in the `categories` array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See Node categories for more information.
`resources` | The `resources` object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI.

## Node categories#

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

  * Data & Storage
  * Finance & Accounting
  * Marketing & Content
  * Productivity
  * Miscellaneous
  * Sales
  * Development
  * Analytics
  * Communication
  * Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`.

# api/authentication/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/api/authentication.md "Edit this page")

# API authentication#

n8n uses API keys to authenticate API calls.

Feature availability

The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.

## API Scopes#

Users of [enterprise instances](https://n8n.io/enterprise/) can limit which resources and actions a key can access with scopes. API key scopes allow you specify the exact level of access a key needs for its intended purpose.

Non-enterprise API keys have full access to all the account's resources and capabilities.

## Create an API key#

  1. Log in to n8n.
  2. Go to **Settings** > **n8n API**.
  3. Select **Create an API key**.
  4. Choose a **Label** and set an **Expiration** time for the key.
  5. If on an enterprise plan, choose the **Scopes** to give the key.
  6. Copy **My API Key** and use this key to authenticate your calls.

## Call the API using your key#

Send the API key in your API call as a header named `X-N8N-API-KEY`.

For example, say you want to get all active workflows. Your curl request will look like this:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    # For a self-hosted n8n instance
    curl -X 'GET' \
      '<N8N_HOST>:<N8N_PORT>/<N8N_PATH>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

    # For n8n Cloud
    curl -X 'GET' \
      '<your-cloud-instance>/api/v<version-number>/workflows?active=true' \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'

---|---

## Delete an API key#

  1. Log in to n8n.
  2. Go to **Settings** > **n8n API**.
  3. Select **Delete** next to the key you want to delete.
  4. Confirm the delete by selecting **Delete Forever**.

# workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow-level executions list#

The **Executions** list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.

Deleted workflows

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

Execution history and workflow history

Don't confuse the execution list with [Workflow history](../../history/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View executions for a single workflow#

In the workflow, select the **Executions** tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.

## Filter executions#

You can filter the executions list.

  1. In your workflow, select **Executions**.
  2. Select **Filters**.
  3. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
     * **Status** : choose from **Failed** , **Running** , **Success** , or **Waiting**.
     * **Execution start** : see executions that started in the given time.
     * **Saved custom data** : this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

       * Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
       * Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

Available in version 0.222.0 and above.

## Retry failed workflows#

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

  1. Open the **Executions** list.
  2. For the workflow execution you want to retry, select **Refresh** ![Refresh icon](../../../_images/common-icons/refresh.png).
  3. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
     * **Retry with currently saved workflow** : Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
     * **Retry with original workflow** : If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.

# Gmail Trigger node#

[Gmail](https://www.gmail.com) is an email service developed by Google. The Gmail Trigger node can start a workflow based on events in Gmail.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/google/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Gmail Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/gmail-trigger/) page.

## Events#

  * **Message Received** : The node triggers for new messages at the selected **Poll Time**.

## Node parameters#

Configure the node with these parameters:

  * **Credential to connect with** : Select or create a new Google credential to use for the trigger. Refer to [Google credentials](../../credentials/google/) for more information on setting up a new credential.
  * **Poll Times** : Select a poll **Mode** to set how often to trigger the poll. Your **Mode** selection will add or remove relevant fields. Refer to [Poll Mode options](poll-mode-options/) to configure the parameters for each mode type.
  * **Simplify** : Choose whether to return a simplified version of the response (turned on, default) or the raw data (turned off).
    * The simplified version returns email message IDs, labels, and email headers, including: From, To, CC, BCC, and Subject.

## Node filters#

Use these filters to further refine the node's behavior:

  * **Include Spam and Trash** : Select whether the node should trigger on new messages in the Spam and Trash folders (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Label Names or IDs** : Only trigger on messages with the selected labels added to them. Select the Label names you want to apply or enter an expression to specify IDs. The dropdown populates based on the **Credential** you selected.
  * **Search** : Enter Gmail search refine filters, like `from:`, to trigger the node on the filtered conditions only. Refer to [Refine searches in Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) for more information.
  * **Read Status** : Choose whether to receive **Unread and read emails** , **Unread emails only** (default), or **Read emails only**.
  * **Sender** : Enter an email or a part of a sender name to trigger only on messages from that sender.

# advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback.md "Edit this page")

# Have a human fallback for AI workflows#

This is a workflow that tries to answer user queries using the standard GPT-4 model. If it can't answer, it sends a message to Slack to ask for human help. It prompts the user to supply an email address.

This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that handles checking for email addresses and sending the Slack message.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/ask_a_human.json)

## Key features#

This workflow uses:

  * [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
  * [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the key piece of the AI workflow. The Agent interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
  * [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): plug in n8n workflows as custom tools. In AI, a tool is an interface the AI can use to interact with the world (in this case, the data provided by your workflow). It allows the AI model to access information beyond its built-in dataset.

## Using the example#

To load the template into your n8n instance:

  1. Download the workflow JSON file.
  2. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
  3. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

  * Yellow: notes and information.
  * Green: instructions to run the workflow.
  * Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
  * Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.textsplittertokensplitter.md "Edit this page")

# Token Splitter node#

The Token Splitter node splits a raw text string by first converting the text into BPE tokens, then splits these tokens into chunks and converts the tokens within a single chunk back into text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Token Splitter node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Chunk Size** : Enter the number of characters in each chunk.
  * **Chunk Overlap** : Enter how much overlap to have between chunks.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/whatsapp.md "Edit this page")

# Facebook Trigger WhatsApp Business Account object#

Use this object to receive updates when your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) changes. Refer to [Facebook Trigger](../) for more information on the trigger itself.

Use WhatsApp trigger

n8n recommends using the [WhatsApp Trigger node](../../n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger/) with the [WhatsApp credentials](../../../credentials/whatsapp/) instead of the Facebook Trigger node. That trigger node includes twice the events to subscribe to.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

## Prerequisites#

This Object requires some configuration in your app and WhatsApp account before you can use the trigger:

  1. Subscribe your app under your WhatsApp business account. You must subscribe an app owned by your business. Apps shared with your business can't receive webhook notifications.
  2. If you are working as a Solution Partner, make sure your app has completed App Review and requested the `whatsapp_business_management` permission.

## Trigger configuration#

To configure the trigger with this Object:

  1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
  2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
  3. Select **WhatsApp Business Account** as the **Object**.
  4. **Field Names or IDs** : By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
     * **Message Template Status Update**
     * **Phone Number Name Update**
     * **Phone Number Quality Update**
     * **Account Review Update**
     * **Account Update**
  5. In **Options** , turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.

Refer to [Webhooks for WhatsApp Business Accounts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started/webhooks-for-whatsapp) and Meta's [WhatsApp Business Account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/reference/whatsapp-business-account/) Graph API reference for more information.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code.md "Edit this page")

# LangChain Code node#

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

Not available on Cloud

This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.

## Node parameters#

### Add Code#

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

  * **Execute** : use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
  * **Supply Data** : use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

### Inputs#

Choose the input types.

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

### Outputs#

Choose the output types.

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration#

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with four LangChain nodes, configured as different node types](../../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchaincode/create-node-types.png)

Node type | Inputs | Outputs | Code mode

## Built-in methods#

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the LangChain Code node.

Method | Description
---|---
`this.addInputData(inputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main input. Useful for mocking data.

  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore`
  * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n.

`this.addOutputData(outputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main output. Useful for mocking data.

  * `outputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore`
  * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n.

`this.getInputConnectionData(inputName, itemIndex, inputIndex?)` | Get data from a specified non-main input.

  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore`
  * `itemIndex` should always be `0` (this parameter will be used in upcoming functionality)
  * Use `inputIndex` if there is more than one node connected to the specified input.

`this.getInputData(inputIndex?, inputName?)` | Get data from the main input.
`this.getNode()` | Get the current node.
`this.getNodeOutputs()` | Get the outputs of the current node.
`this.getExecutionCancelSignal()` | Use this to stop the execution of a function when the workflow stops. In most cases n8n handles this, but you may need to use it if building your own chains or agents. It replaces the [Cancelling a running LLMChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain#cancelling-a-running-llmchain) code that you'd use if building a LangChain application normally.

# Built-in date and time methods#

Methods for working with date and time.

Python support

You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.

JavaScriptPython

Method | Description | Available in Code node?
---|---|---
`$now` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`. | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)
`$today` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`. | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)

Method | Description
---|---
`_now` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.
`_today` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.

n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon helps you do this. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes.md "Edit this page")

# Block access to nodes#

For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.

Use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.

## Exclude nodes#

Update your `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.

For example, setting the variable this way:

    1

|

    NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\", \"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\"]"

---|---

Blocks the [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) nodes.

Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.

## Suggested nodes to block#

The nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:

  * [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)
  * [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)

## Related resources#

Refer to [Nodes environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on this environment variable.

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

# Groq Chat Model node#

Use the Groq Chat Model node to access Groq's large language models for conversational AI and text generation tasks.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Groq Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/groq/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the Groq API. Learn more in the [Groq model documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).

## Node options#

  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

# Schedule Trigger node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Schedule Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Invalid cron expression#

This error occurs when you set **Trigger Interval** to **Custom (Cron)** and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.

To debug, check that the following:

  * That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](../#custom-cron-interval)
  * That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](../#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)

## Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time#

If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.

### Adjust the timezone globally#

If you're using [n8n Cloud](../../../../../manage-cloud/overview/), follow the instructions on the [set the Cloud instance timezone](../../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.

If you're [self hosting](../../../../../hosting/), set your global timezone using the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/).

### Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow#

To set the timezone for an individual workflow:

  1. Open the workflow on the canvas.
  2. Select the ![three dots menu](../../../../../_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) **Three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
  3. Select **Settings**.
  4. Change the **Timezone** setting.
  5. Select **Save**.

### Variables not working as expected#

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.

### Changing the trigger interval#

You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.

Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it.

# Question and Answer Chain node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Question and Answer Chain node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## No prompt specified error#

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

  1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
     * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
     * Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
  2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
     * To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.
     * Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error#

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.

To resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.

## Can't produce longer responses#

If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:

  * **Connect a more verbose model** : Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.
  * **Increase the maximum number of tokens** : Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.
  * **Build larger responses in stages** : For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/).

# integrations/builtin/credentials/ghost/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/ghost.md "Edit this page")

# Ghost credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Ghost](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ghost/)

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Admin API key
  * Content API key

The keys are generated following the same steps, but the authorization flows and key format are different, so n8n stores the credentials separately. The Content API uses an API key; the Admin API uses an API key to generate a token for authentication.

## Related resources#

Refer to Ghost's [Admin API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/) for more information about the Admin API service. Refer to Ghost's [Content API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/) for more information about the Content API service.

## Using Admin API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **URL** of your Ghost admin domain. Your [admin domain](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#base-url) can be different to your main domain and may include a subdirectory. All Ghost(Pro) blogs have a `*.ghost.io` domain as their admin domain and require https.
  * An **API Key** : To generate a new API key, create a new Custom Integration. Refer to the [Ghost Admin API Token Authentication Key documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#token-authentication) for more detailed instructions. Copy the **Admin API Key** and use this as the **API Key** in the Ghost Admin n8n credential.

## Using Content API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **URL** of your Ghost admin domain. Your [admin domain](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/#url) can be different to your main domain and may include a subdirectory. All Ghost(Pro) blogs have a `*.ghost.io` domain as their admin domain and require https.
  * An **API Key** : To generate a new API key, create a new Custom Integration. Refer to the [Ghost Content API Key documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/#key) for more detailed instructions. Copy the **Content API Key** and use this as the **API Key** in the Ghost Content n8n credential.

# code/code-node/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/code-node.md "Edit this page")

# Using the Code node#

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

Coding in n8n

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](../) section. It includes:

  * Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/)
  * Guidance on [Handling dates](../cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](../cookbook/jmespath/)
  * A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](../cookbook/code-node/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.

Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

## Usage#

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode#

There are two modes:

  * **Run Once for All Items** : this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
  * **Run Once for Each Item** : choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript#

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features#

The Code node supports:

  * Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
  * Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries#

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

  * [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
  * [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables#

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts#

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python#

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables#

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts#

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests#

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

  * [Read/Write File From Disk](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
  * [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Coding in n8n#

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts#

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

  * [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
  * [Item linking](../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables#

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

  * Accessing specific item data
  * Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
  * Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node#

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

  1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
  2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
  3. Write your query.
  4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/webhook.md "Edit this page")

# Webhook credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Webhook](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/)

## Prerequisites#

You must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Basic auth
  * Header auth
  * JWT auth
  * None

## Using basic auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
  * The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using header auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
  * The **Value** for the header

Read more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication)

## Using JWT auth#

[**JWT Auth**](https://jwt.io/introduction/) is a method of authentication that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to digitally sign data. This authentication method uses the **JWT credential** and can use either a **Passphrase** or **PEM Key** as key type. Refer to [JWT credential](../jwt/) for more information.

# Auto-fixing Output Parser node#

The Auto-fixing Output Parser node wraps another output parser. If the first one fails, it calls out to another LLM to fix any errors.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus.md "Edit this page")

# Enable Prometheus metrics#

To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the [prom-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prom-client) library.

The `/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the `N8N_METRICS` environment variable.

    1

|

    export N8N_METRICS=true

---|---

Refer to the respective [Environment Variables](../../environment-variables/endpoints/) (`N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*`) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.

Both `main` and `worker` instances are able to expose metrics.

## Queue metrics#

To enable queue metrics, set the `N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS` env var to `true`. You can adjust the refresh rate with `N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL`.

Queue metrics are only available for the `main` instance in single-main mode.

# workflows/sharing/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/sharing.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow sharing#

Feature availability

Available on Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.

Workflow sharing allows you to share workflows between users of the same n8n instance.

Users can share workflows they created. Instance owners, and users with the admin role, can view and share all workflows in the instance. Refer to [Account types](../../user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

## Share a workflow#

  1. Open the workflow you want to share.
  2. Select **Share**.
  3. In **Add users** , find and select the users you want to share with.
  4. Select **Save**.

## View shared workflows#

You can browse and search workflows on the **Workflows** list. The workflows in the list depend on the project:

  * **Overview** lists all workflows you can access. This includes:
    * Your own workflows.
    * Workflows shared with you.
    * Workflows in projects you're a member of.
    * If you log in as the instance owner or admin: all workflows in the instance.
  * Other projects: all workflows in the project.

## Workflow roles and permissions#

There are two workflow roles: creator and editor. The creator is the user who created the workflow. Editors are other users with access to the workflow.

You can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.

Credentials

Workflow sharing allows editors to use all [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](../../credentials/credential-sharing/).

### Permissions#

Permissions | Creator | Editor
---|---|---
View workflow (read-only) | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg) | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)

## Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials#

Sharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.

Refer to [Credential sharing](../../credentials/credential-sharing/) for guidance on sharing credentials.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/timescaledb/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/timescaledb.md "Edit this page")

# TimescaleDB credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [TimescaleDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/)

## Prerequisites#

An available instance of [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/).

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Database connection

## Related resources#

Refer to [Timescale's documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **Host** : The fully qualified server name or IP address of your TimescaleDB server.
  * The **Database** : The name of the database to connect to.
  * A **User** : The user name you want to log in with.
  * A **Password** : Enter the password for the database user you are connecting to.
  * **Ignore SSL Issues** : If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails and you won't see the **SSL** selector.
  * **SSL** : This setting controls the `ssl-mode` connection string for the connection. Options include:
    * **Allow** : Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `allow`. First try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection.
    * **Disable** : Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `disable`. Only try a non-SSL connection.
    * **Require** : Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `require`, which is the default for TimescaleDB connection strings. Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify that a trusted certificate authority (CA) issued the server certificate.
  * **Port** : The port number of the TimescaleDB server.

Refer to [Timescale's connection settings documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/integrations/query-admin/qstudio/#connection-settings) for more information about the non-SSL fields. Refer to [Connect with a stricter SSL](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/security/strict-ssl/) for more information about the SSL options.

# hosting/configuration/user-management-self-hosted/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/user-management-self-hosted.md "Edit this page")

# Configure self-hosted n8n for user management#

User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance.

This document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.

Refer to the main [User management](../../../user-management/) guide for more information about usage, including:

  * [Managing users](../../../user-management/manage-users/)
  * [Account types](../../../user-management/account-types/)
  * [Best practices](../../../user-management/best-practices/)

For LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](../../../user-management/ldap/).

For SAML setup information, refer to [SAML](../../../user-management/saml/).

Basic auth and JWT removed

n8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.

## Setup#

There are three stages to set up user management in n8n:

  1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.
  2. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.
  3. Invite users.

### Step one: SMTP#

n8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets.

Optional from 0.210.1

From version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.

Get the following information from your SMTP provider:

  * Server name
  * SMTP username
  * SMTP password
  * SMTP sender name

To set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to [Configuration](../configuration-methods/)

Variable | Type | Description | Required?
---|---|---|---
`N8N_EMAIL_MODE` | string | `smtp` | Required
`N8N_SMTP_HOST` | string | _your_SMTP_server_name_ | Required
`N8N_SMTP_PORT` | number | _your_SMTP_server_port_ Default is `465`. | Optional
`N8N_SMTP_USER` | string | _your_SMTP_username_ | Optional
`N8N_SMTP_PASS` | string | _your_SMTP_password_ | Optional
`N8N_SMTP_OAUTH_SERVICE_CLIENT` | string | _your_OAuth_service_client_ | Optional
`N8N_SMTP_OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY` | string | _your_OAuth_private_key_ | Optional
`N8N_SMTP_SENDER` | string | Sender email address. You can optionally include the sender name. Example with name: _N8N`<contact@n8n.com>`_ | Required
`N8N_SMTP_SSL` | boolean | Whether to use SSL for SMTP (true) or not (false). Defaults to `true`. | Optional
`N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_INVITE` | string | Full path to your HTML email template. This overrides the default template for invite emails. | Optional
`N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_PWRESET` | string | Full path to your HTML email template. This overrides the default template for password reset emails. | Optional
`N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_WORKFLOW_SHARED` | String | Overrides the default HTML template for notifying users that a credential was shared. Provide the full path to the template. | Optional
`N8N_UM_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_CREDENTIALS_SHARED` | String | Overrides the default HTML template for notifying users that a credential was shared. Provide the full path to the template. | Optional

If your n8n instance is already running, you need to restart it to enable the new SMTP settings.

More configuration options

There are more configuration options available as environment variables. Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for a list. These include options to disable tags, workflow templates, and the personalization survey, if you don't want your users to see them.

New to SMTP?

If you're not familiar with SMTP, this [blog post by SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) offers a short introduction, while [Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) provides more detailed technical background.

### Step two: In-app setup#

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

  1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
  2. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
  3. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.

### Step three: Invite users#

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.

  1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)
  2. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
  3. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
  4. Click **Invite**.
  5. Enter the new user's email address.
  6. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.

# integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Telegram Trigger node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event#

When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook#

This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.

To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.

## Workflow only works in testing or production#

Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.

To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.

To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

  1. Go to your workflow page.
  2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
  3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
  4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# source-control-environments/setup/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/setup.md "Edit this page")

# Set up source control for environments#

Link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

n8n uses source control to provide environments. Refer to [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/) for more information.

## Prerequisites#

To use source control with n8n, you need a Git repository that allows SSH access.

This document assumes you are familiar with Git and your Git provider.

## Step 1: Set up your repository and branches#

For a new setup:

  1. Create a new repository for use with n8n.
  2. Create the branches you need. For example, if you plan to have different environments for test and production, set up a branch for each.

To help decide what branches you need for your use case, refer to [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/).

## Step 2: Configure Git in n8n#

  1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
  2. In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.
  3. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.
  4. Copy the SSH key.

## Step 3: Set up a deploy key#

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access.

The steps depend on your Git provider. Help links for common providers:

  * [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)
  * [GitLab | Deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)

## Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance#

  1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
  2. Under **Instance settings** , choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance.
  3. **Optional** : select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. This is useful for protecting production instances.
  4. **Optional** : choose a custom color for the instance. This will appear in the menu next to the source control push and pull buttons. It helps users know which instance they're in.
  5. Select **Save settings**.

# Google Drive Trigger node#

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. It allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/google/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Google Drive Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/google-drive-trigger/) page.

Manual Executions vs. Activation

On manual executions this node will return the last event matching its search criteria. If no event matches the criteria (for example because you are watching for files to be created but no files have been created so far), an error is thrown. Once saved and activated, the node will regularly check for any matching events and will trigger your workflow for each event found.

# Text Classifier node#

Use the Text Classifier node to classify (categorize) incoming data. Using the categories provided in the parameters (see below), each item is passed to the model to determine its category.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Text Classifier node, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters#

  * **Input Prompt** defines the input to classify. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger. By default it references the `text` field.
  * **Categories** : Add the categories that you want to classify your input as. Categories have a name and a description. Use the description to tell the model what the category means. This is important if the meaning isn't obvious. You can add as many categories as you like.

## Node options#

  * **Allow Multiple Classes To Be True** : You can configure the classifier to always output a single class per item (turned off), or allow the model to select multiple classes (turned on).
  * **When No Clear Match** : Define what happens if the model can't find a good match for an item. There are two options:
    * **Discard Item** (the default): If the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it drops the item.
    * **Output on Extra, 'Other' Branch** : Creates a separate output branch called **Other**. When the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it outputs items in this branch.
  * **System Prompt Template** : Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the classification. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.

  * **Enable Auto-Fixing** : When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md "Edit this page")

# Facebook App credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Facebook Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/)

Facebook Graph API credentials

If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Graph API](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi/) node, follow the instructions in the [Facebook Graph API credentials](../facebookgraph/) documentation.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * App access token

## Related resources#

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

  * An app **Access Token**
  * An optional **App Secret** : Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload.

There are five steps in setting up your credential:

  1. Create a Meta app with the Webhooks product.
  2. Generate an App Access Token for that app.
  3. Configure the Facebook trigger.
  4. Optional: Add an app secret.
  5. App Review: Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app#

To create a Meta app:

  1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
  2. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
  3. Select **Other** , then select **Next**.
  4. Select **Business** and **Next**.
  5. Complete the essential information:
     * Add an **App name**.
     * Add an **App contact email**.
     * Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
  6. Select **Create app**.
  7. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
  8. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
  9. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
  10. Select **Save changes**.
  11. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
  12. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
  13. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.
  14. The **Webhooks** product opens.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token#

Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:

  1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).
  2. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.
  3. In **User or Page** , select **Get App Token**.
  4. Select **Generate Access Token**.
  5. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

App unavailable

You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.

  6. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.

  7. Save your n8n credential.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

### Configure the Facebook Trigger#

Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:

  1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.
  2. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
  3. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.
  4. Select **Execute step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.
  5. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.
  6. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
     1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.
     2. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.
     3. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
     4. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User** , prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
     5. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.

Refer to the [Facebook Trigger node](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.

### Optional: Add an App Secret#

For added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.

To generate an App Secret:

  1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
  2. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.
  3. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
  4. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.
  5. **Save** your n8n credential.

Refer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret) for more information.

### App review#

App Review requires Business Verification.

Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:

  * Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
  * Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.

If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.

As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.

Refer to Meta's [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review) and [Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels#advanced-access) documentation for more information.

## Common issues#

### Unverified apps limit#

Facebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.

Refer to [Limitations | Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app#limitations) if you're over that limit.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.sentimentanalysis.md "Edit this page")

# Sentiment Analysis node#

Use the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.

The language model uses the **Sentiment Categories** in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.

## Node parameters#

  * **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.

## Node options#

  * **Sentiment Categories** : Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.
    * By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.
  * **Include Detailed Results** : When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.
  * **System Prompt Template** : Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
  * **Enable Auto-Fixing** : When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

## Usage Notes#

### Model Temperature Setting#

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations#

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.

### Processing Large Volumes#

When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.

### Iterative Refinement#

For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.

## Example Usage#

### Basic Sentiment Analysis#

  1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.
  2. Set the "Text to Analyze" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).
  3. Keep the default sentiment categories.
  4. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.

### Custom Category Analysis#

  1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.
  2. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.
  3. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/wolframalpha.md "Edit this page")

# Wolfram|Alpha credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Wolfram|Alpha](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwolframalpha/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key

## Related resources#

Refer to [Wolfram|Alpha's Simple API documentation](https://products.wolframalpha.com/simple-api/documentation) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a registered [Wolfram ID](https://account.wolfram.com) and:

  * An **App ID**

To get an App ID:

  1. Open the Wolfram|Alpha Developer Portal and go to [**API Access**](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/access).
  2. Select **Get an App ID**.
  3. Enter a **Name** for your application, like `n8n integration`.
  4. Enter a **Description** for your application.
  5. Select **Simple API** as the **API**.
  6. Select **Submit**.
  7. Copy the generated **App ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to **Getting Started** in the [Wolfram|Alpha Simple API documentation](https://products.wolframalpha.com/simple-api/documentation) for more information.

## Resolve Forbidden connection error#

If you enter your App ID and get an error that the credential is **Forbidden** , make sure that you have verified your email address for your Wolfram ID:

  1. Go to your [Wolfram ID Details](https://account.wolfram.com/wolframid).
  2. If you don't see the **Verified** label underneath your **Email address** , select the link to **Send a verification email**.
  3. You must open the link in that email to verify your email address.

It may take several minutes for the verification to populate to the API, but once it does, retrying the n8n credential should succeed.

Refer to [WhatsApp's documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api) for details about their API.

## Common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production#

WhatsApp only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), WhatsApp overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. WhatsApp will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

  1. Go to your workflow page.
  2. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
  3. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
  4. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize.md "Edit this page")

# Summarize#

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Node parameters#

### Fields to Summarize#

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

  * **Aggregation** : Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
    * **Append** : Append
      * If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
    * **Average** : Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
    * **Concatenate** : Combine together values in your input data.
      * If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
      * **Separator** : Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
    * **Count** : Count the total number of values in your input data.
    * **Count Unique** : Count the number of unique values in your input data.
    * **Max** : Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
    * **Min** : Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
    * **Sum** : Add together the numeric values in your input data.
  * **Field** : Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By#

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

## Node options#

### Continue if Field Not Found#

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation#

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Output Format#

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

  * **Each Split in a Separate Item** : Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
  * **All Splits in a Single Item** : Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by#

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).

# api/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/api/index.md "Edit this page")

# n8n public REST API#

Feature availability

The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.

Using n8n's public [API](../glossary/#api), you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. This section introduces n8n's REST API, including:

  * How to [authenticate](authentication/)
  * [Paginating](pagination/) results
  * Using the [built-in API playground](using-api-playground/) (self-hosted n8n only)
  * [Endpoint reference](api-reference/)

n8n provides an [n8n API node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

## Learn about REST APIs#

The API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:

  * [KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs](https://support.knowledgeowl.com/help/working-with-apis): a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.
  * [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api): this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.
  * [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis): more detailed information about REST APIs.
  * [MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview): REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.

Use the API playground (self-hosted n8n only)

Trying out the API in the [playground](using-api-playground/) can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.

# code/expressions/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/expressions.md "Edit this page")

# Expressions#

Expressions are a powerful feature implemented in all n8n nodes. They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from:

  * Previous node executions
  * The workflow
  * Your n8n environment

You can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code.

n8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament), and extends it with [custom methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) and [data transformation functions](../builtin/data-transformation-functions/). These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata.

n8n additionally supports two libraries:

  * [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/), for working with dates and time.
  * [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), for querying JSON.

Data in n8n

When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](../../data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.

## Writing expressions#

To use an expression to set a parameter value:

  1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
  2. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.
  3. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor** ![Open expressions editor icon](../../_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.

### Example: Get data from webhook body#

Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.

Your webhook data looks similar to this:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15

|

    [
      {
        "headers": {
          "host": "n8n.instance.address",
          ...
        },
        "params": {},
        "query": {},
        "body": {
          "name": "Jim",
          "age": 30,
          "city": "New York"
        }
      }
    ]

---|---

In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:

    1

|

    {{$json.body.city}}

---|---

This expression:

  1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.
  2. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, "New York"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.

### Example: Writing longer JavaScript#

An expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.

To understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression.

However, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    // This example is split over multiple lines for readability
    // It's still invalid when formatted as a single line
    {{
      function example() {
        let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');
        let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');
        let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');
        return diffInMonths.toObject();
      }
      example();
    }}

---|---

While the second example is valid:

    1

|

    {{DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months').toObject()}}

---|---

# Zoom credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Zoom](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zoom/)

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) account. Your account must have one of the following permissions:

  * Account owner
  * Account admin
  * Zoom for developers role

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API JWT token
  * OAuth2

API JWT token deprecation

Zoom removed support for JWT access tokens in June 2023. You must use OAuth2 for all new credentials.

## Related resources#

Refer to [Zoom's API documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/) for more information about the service.

## Using API JWT token#

This authentication method has been fully deprecated by Zoom. Don't create new credentials with it.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **JWT token** : To create a JWT token, create a new JWT app in the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).

## Using OAuth2#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * A **Client ID** : Generated when you create an OAuth app on the Zoom App Marketplace.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated when you create an OAuth app.

To generate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** , [create an OAuth app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/).

Use these settings for your OAuth app:

  * Select **User-managed app** for **Select how the app is managed**.

# Gmail node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Gmail node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages#

If you're using the node to [send a message](../message-operations/#send-a-message) or [reply to a message](../message-operations/#reply-to-a-message), the node appends this statement to the end of the email:

> This email was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

  1. In the node's **Options** section, select **Add option**.
  2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
  3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send options](../message-operations/#send-options) and [Reply options](../message-operations/#reply-options) for more information.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials#

This error displays next to certain dropdowns in the node, like the **Label Names or IDs** dropdown. The full text looks something like this:

    1

|

    There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"

---|---

The error most often displays when you're using a Google Service Account as the credential and the credential doesn't have **Impersonate a User** turned on.

Refer to [Google Service Account: Finish your n8n credential](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#finish-your-n8n-credential) for more information.

## 401 unauthorized error#

The full text of the error looks like this:

    1

|

    401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}

---|---

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

  1. For [OAuth2](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Gmail API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
  2. For [Service Account](../../../credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
     1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
     2. Make sure you add the Gmail API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Bad request - please check your parameters#

This error most often occurs if you enter a Message ID, Thread ID, or Label ID that doesn't exist.

Try a **Get** operation with the ID to confirm it exists.

# Embeddings Mistral Cloud node#

Use the Embeddings Mistral Cloud node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Mistral Cloud node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mistral/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

Learn more about available models in [Mistral's models documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/pricing/).

## Node options#

  * **Batch Size** : Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.
  * **Strip New Lines** : Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.

# integrations/builtin/rate-limits/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/rate-limits.md "Edit this page")

# Handling API rate limits#

[API](../../../glossary/#api) rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.

APIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.

## Identify rate limit issues#

When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.

If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.

To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.

## Handle rate limits for integrations#

There are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) and [Wait](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) nodes:

  * Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.
  * With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.

### Enable Retry On Fail#

When you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.

  1. Open the node.
  2. Select **Settings**.
  3. Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.
  4. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Use Loop Over Items and Wait#

Use the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.

  1. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) for information on how to configure the node.
  2. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) for information on how to configure the node.

For example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:

!["Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs"](../../../_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)

## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node#

The HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.

### Batch requests#

Use the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.
  2. Set **Items per Batch** : this is the number of input items to include in each request.
  3. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.

### Paginate results#

APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination).

# courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1.md "Edit this page")

# 1\. Getting data from the data warehouse#

In this part of the workflow, you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests with the [**HTTP Request**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.

After completing this section, your workflow will look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1.json)

First, let's set the scene for building Nathan's workflow.

## Create new workflow#

Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:

  * Select `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`N` or `Cmd`+`Option`+`N` on your keyboard.
  * Open the left menu, navigate to **Workflows** , and select **Add workflow**.

Name this new workflow "Nathan's workflow."

The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.

In a previous chapter, you used an action node designed for a specific service (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.

Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node in n8n.

No node for that service?

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.

## Add an HTTP Request node#

Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson [Adding nodes](../../chapter-1/#adding-nodes). The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.

![HTTP Request node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node.png)_HTTP Request node_

This node will use credentials.

Credentials

[Credentials](../../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and allow them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.

In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI).

In the **Parameters** of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:

  * **Method** : This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.
  * **URL** : Add the **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
  * **Send Headers** : Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers** , ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.
    * **Header Parameters** > **Name** : Enter `unique_id`.
    * **Header Parameters** > **Value** : The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
  * **Authentication** : Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials before allowing you to access the data.
    * **Generic Auth Type** : Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)
    * **Credential for Header Auth** : To add your credentials, select **\+ Create new credential**. This will open the Credentials window.
    * In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the **Header Auth name** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    * In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the **Header Auth value** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
    * Select the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this: ![HTTP Request node credentials](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-credentials.png)_HTTP Request node credentials_

Credentials naming

New credential names follow the " account" format by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

Once you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node.

## Get the data#

Select the **Execute step** button in the HTTP Request node window. The table view of the HTTP request results should look like this:

![HTTP Request node output](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-window.png)_HTTP Request node output_

This view should be familiar to you from the [Building a mini-workflow](../../chapter-2/) page.

This is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information from 30 customers with five columns:

  * `orderID`: The unique id of each order.
  * `customerID`: The unique id of each customer.
  * `employeeName`: The name of Nathan's colleague responsible for the customer.
  * `orderPrice`: The total price of the customer's order.
  * `orderStatus`: Whether the customer's order status is `booked` or still in `processing`.

## What's next?#

**Nathan 🙋** : This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.

**You 👩‍🔧** : Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the data you retrieved into Airtable.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url.md "Edit this page")

# Configure n8n webhooks with reverse proxy#

n8n creates the webhook URL by combining `N8N_PROTOCOL`, `N8N_HOST` and `N8N_PORT`. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443. In that case, it's important to set the webhook URL manually so that n8n can display it in the Editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.

# MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node#

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is a feature of MongoDB Atlas that enables users to store and query vector embeddings. Use this node to interact with Vector Search indexes in your MongoDB Atlas collections. You can insert documents, retrieve documents, and use the vector store in chains or as a tool for agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mongodb/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Prerequisites#

Before using this node, create a [Vector Search index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/) in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Follow these steps to create one:

  1. Log in to the [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

  2. Select your organization and project.

  3. Find "Search & Vector Search" section.
  4. Select your cluster and click "Go to search".
  5. Click "Create Search Index".
  6. Choose "Vector Search" mode and use the visual or JSON editors. For example:

         1
          2
          3
          4
          5
          6
          7
          8
          9
         10

|

         {
           "fields": [
             {
               "type": "vector",
               "path": "<field-name>",
               "numDimensions": 1536, // any other value
               "similarity": "<similarity-function>"
             }
           ]
         }

---|---

  7. Adjust the "dimensions" value according to your embedding model (For example, `1536` for OpenAI's `text-embedding-small-3`).

  8. Name your index and create.

Make sure to note the following values which are required when configuring the node:

  * Collection name
  * Vector index name
  * Field names for embeddings and metadata

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node in the following patterns:

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents#

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use the vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node to fetch documents from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarize data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the In-Memory Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store.

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Mongo Collection** : Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use.
  * **Vector Index Name** : Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection.
  * **Embedding Field** : Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings.
  * **Metadata Field** : Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Mongo Collection** : Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use.
  * **Vector Index Name** : Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection.
  * **Embedding Field** : Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings.
  * **Metadata Field** : Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata.

### Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

  * **Mongo Collection** : Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use.
  * **Vector Index Name** : Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection.
  * **Embedding Field** : Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings.
  * **Metadata Field** : Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Mongo Collection** : Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use.
  * **Vector Index Name** : Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options#

### Options#

  * **Metadata Filter** : Filters results based on metadata.

# Programmatic-style execute() method#

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.

The `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.

Paired items

You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to [Paired items](../../paired-items/).

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow.md "Edit this page")

# Execute Sub-workflow#

Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

## Node parameters#

### Source#

Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:

  * **Database** : Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
    * **From list** : Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
    * **Workflow ID** : Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after `/workflow/`. For example, if the URL of a workflow is `https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`, the **Workflow ID** is `abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`.
  * **Local File** : Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
    * **Workflow Path** : Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
  * **Parameter** : Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
    * **Workflow JSON** : Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
  * **URL** : Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
    * **Workflow URL** : Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.

### Workflow Inputs#

If you select a sub-workflow using the **database** and **From list** options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.

You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives `null` as the item's value. You can also enable **Attempt to convert types** to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.

Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.

### Mode#

Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:

  * **Run once with all items** : Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
  * **Run once for each item** : Execute the node once for each input item in turn.

## Node options#

This node includes one option: **Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion**. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

## Set up and use a sub-workflow#

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow#

  1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](./) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

  2. **Optional** : configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

     1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](../../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
     2. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
  3. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).
  4. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
     * **Define using fields below** : Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](./) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
     * **Define using JSON example** : Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
     * **Accept all data** : Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
  5. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
  6. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

  1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
  2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
  3. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
  4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
  5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/).
  6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow#

  1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
  2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.
  3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

  4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

  5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows#

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B** :

  1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
  2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development.md "Edit this page")

# Workflow development#

The [Webhook node](../) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows#

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.

Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.

When using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](../../../../../hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:

  * [npm with tunnel](../../../../../hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)
  * [Docker with tunnel](../../../../../hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)

## Production workflows#

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.

When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.

Refer to [Create a workflow](../../../../../workflows/create/) for more information on activating workflows.

# Building a Mini-workflow#

In this lesson, you will build a small [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) that gets 10 articles about automation from Hacker News. The process consists of five steps:

  1. Add a Manual Trigger node
  2. Add the Hacker News node
  3. Configure the Hacker News node
  4. Execute the node
  5. Save the workflow

The finished workflow will look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-2.json)

## 1\. Add a Manual Trigger node#

Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the **+** icon in the top right corner of the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) or selecting `Tab` on your keyboard).

Then:

  1. Search for the **Manual Trigger** node.
  2. Select it when it appears in the search.

This will add the [Manual Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) node to your canvas, which allows you to run the workflow at any time by selecting the **Execute workflow** button.

Manual triggers

For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.

In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to set up a schedule or some other [trigger](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) to run the workflow.

## 2\. Add the Hacker News node#

Select the **+** icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.

Then:

  1. Search for the **Hacker News** node.
  2. Select it when it appears in the search.
  3. In the **Actions** section, select **Get many items**.

n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.

## 3\. Configure the Hacker News node#

When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options:

  * **Parameters** : Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality.
  * **Settings** : Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions.
  * **Docs** : Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window.

Parameters vs. Settings

  * **Parameters** are different for each node, depending on its functionality.
  * **Settings** are the same for all nodes.

### Parameters#

We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work:

  * **Resource** : All
This resource selects all data records (articles).
  * **Operation** : Get Many
This operation fetches all the selected articles.
  * **Limit** : 10
This parameter sets a limit to the number of results the Get Many operation returns.
  * **Additional Fields** > **Add Field** > **Keyword** : automation
**Additional fields** are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword "automation."

The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

![Hacker News node parameters](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c-2-hacker-news-node-parameters.png)_Hacker News node parameters_

### Settings#

The **Settings** section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.

In the Hacker News node Settings, edit:

  * **Notes** : Get the 10 latest articles.

Node notes

It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is helpful for complex or shared workflows in particular!

  * **Display note in flow?** : toggle to true
This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.

The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

![Hacker News node settings](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-hacker-news-node-setting-configuration.png)_Hacker News node settings_

Renaming a node

You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:

  * Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.
  * Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click **Rename** to save the node under the new name.
  * Right-click on the node and select the **Rename** option.

![Renaming a node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-renaming-a-node-from-the-keyboard.png)_Renaming a node from the keyboard_

To find the original node name (the type of node), open the node window and select **Settings**. The bottom of the page contains the node type and version.

## 4\. Execute the node#

Select the **Execute step** button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output **Table** view.

![Results in Table view for the Hacker News node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-table-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png)_Results in Table view for the Hacker News node_

### Node executions#

Node execution

A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve or process the specified data.

If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas

![Successfully executed workflow](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-successfully-executed-workflow.png)_Successfully executed workflow_

If there are no problems with the parameters and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in **Table** , **JSON** , and **Schema** format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table | JSON | Schema** button at the top of the node window.

Table vs JSON views

The **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.

Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view:

![Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-json-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png)_Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node_

The node window displays more information about the node execution:

  * Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node execution succeeded). Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:
    * **Start Time** : When the node execution started.
    * **Execution Time** : How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing.
  * Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.

Error in nodes

A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.

![Error in nodes](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/error-node.png)_Error in nodes_

## 5\. Save the workflow#

Once you're finished editing the node, select **Back to canvas** to return to the main canvas.

By default, your workflow is automatically saved as "My workflow."

For this lesson, rename the workflow to be "Hacker News workflow."

Reminder

You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.

Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.

There are two ways in which you can save a workflow:

  * From the Canvas in Editor UI, click **Ctrl + S** or **Cmd + S** on your keyboard.
  * Select the **Save** button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.

If you see a grey **Saved** text instead of the **Save** button, your workflow was automatically saved.

## Summary#

Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.

In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/homeassistant/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/homeassistant.md "Edit this page")

# Home Assistant credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Home Assistant](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.homeassistant/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token

## Related resources#

Refer to [Home Assistant's API documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need to [Install](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) Home Assistant, create a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding) account, and have:

  * Your **Host**
  * The **Port**
  * A Long-Lived **Access Token**

To generate an access token and set up the credential:

  1. To generate your **Access Token** , log in to Home Assistant and open your [User profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile).
  2. In the **Long-Lived Access Tokens** section, generate a new token.
  3. Copy this token and enter it in n8n as your **Access Token**.
  4. Enter the URL or IP address of your Home Assistant **Host** , without the `http://` or `https://` protocol, for example `your.awesome.home`.
  5. For the **Port** , enter the appropriate port:
     * If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `http://`, keep the default of `8123`.
     * If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `https://`, enter `443`.
     * If you've configured Home Assistant to use a specific port, enter that port.
  6. If you've enabled SSL in Home Assistant in the [config.yml map key](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/?_highlight=ssl#add-on-configuration), turn on the **SSL** toggle in n8n. If you're not sure, it's best to turn this setting on if you access your home assistant UI using `https://` instead of `http://`.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-two/chapter-1.md "Edit this page")

# Understanding the data structure#

In this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to transform data and simulate node outputs.

## Data structure of n8n#

In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.

The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.

About array of objects

An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Donatello", "Raphael"];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.

An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    {
    	name: 'Michelangelo',
    	color: 'blue',
    }

---|---

An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17
    18

|

    var turtles = [
    	{
    		name: 'Michelangelo',
    		color: 'orange',
    	},
    	{
    		name: 'Donatello',
    		color: 'purple',
    	},
    	{
    		name: 'Raphael',
    		color: 'red',
    	},
    	{
    		name: 'Leonardo',
    		color: 'blue',
    	}
    ];

---|---

You can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.

Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_items.png)_Items_

An n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.

![](/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)_Items in the Customer Datastore node_

## Creating data sets with the Code node#

Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    return [
    	{
    		json: {
    			apple: 'beets',
    		}
    	}
    ];

---|---

For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_notnested.png)_Array of objects in the Code node_

JSON objects

Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_datastructure.png)_Illustration of data structure in n8n_

It's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the `json` key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.

You can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.

[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQHT3Unn4tY) offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n.

### Exercise#

In a Code node, create an array of objects named `myContacts` that contains the properties `name` and `email`, and the `email` property is further split into `personal` and `work`.

Show me the solution

In the **Code node** , in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17
    18
    19
    20
    21
    22

|

    var myContacts = [
    	{
    		json: {
    			name: 'Alice',
    			email: {
    				personal: 'alice@home.com',
    				work: 'alice@wonderland.org'
    			},
    		}
    	},
    	{
    		json: {
    			name: 'Bob',
    			email: {
    				personal: 'bob@mail.com',
    				work: 'contact@thebuilder.com'
    				},
    		}
    	},
    ];

    return myContacts;

---|---

When you execute the **Code node** , the result should look like this:

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function.png)_Result of Code node_

## Referencing node data with the Code node#

Just like you can use [expressions](../../../code/expressions/) to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some [methods and variables](../../../code/builtin/overview/) in the **Code node**.

Please make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.

### Exercise#

Let's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named `workEmail` that references the work email of the first contact.

Show me the solution

In the **Code node** , in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:

    1
    2
    3

|

    let items = $input.all();
    items[0].json.workEmail = items[0].json.email['work'];
    return items;

---|---

When you execute the **Code node** , the result should look like this:

![](/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_reference.png)_Code node reference_

## Transforming data#

The incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to [transform the data](../../../data/transforming-data/), so that each item can be processed individually.

The two most common operations for data transformation are:

  * Creating multiple items from one item
  * Creating a single item from multiple items

There are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:

  * Use n8n's [data transformation nodes](../../../data/#data-transformation-nodes). Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the **Code node** :
    * Use the [**Split Out node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
    * Use the [**Aggregate node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
  * Use the **Code node** to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the **Run Once for All Items** mode:
    * To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named `data` set to an array of items in the form of: `[{ "data": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`:

          1
          2
          3
          4
          5

|

          return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {
              return {
                  json: item
              }
          });

---|---

    * To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:

          1
          2
          3
          4
          5
          6
          7

|

          return [
          	{
              	json: {
              		data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)
              	}
              }
            ];

---|---

These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    let items = $input.all();
    return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => {
    	return {
    		json: item
    	}
    });

---|---

### Exercise#

  1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the PokéAPI `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`. (This API requires no authentication).
  2. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Split Out node**.
  3. Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Code node**.

Show me the solution

  1. To get the pokemon from the PokéAPI, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
     * **Authentication** : None
     * **Request Method** : GET
     * **URL** : https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
  2. To transform the data with the **Split Out node** , connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and set the following parameters:
     * **Field To Split Out** : results
     * **Include** : No Other Fields
  3. To transform the data with the **Code node** , connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and write the following code in the JavaScript Code field:

         1
         2
         3
         4
         5
         6

|

         let items = $input.all();
         return items[0].json.results.map(item => {
         	return {
         		json: item
         	}
         });

# Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow#

Every item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.

To access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `("<node-name>").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.

For example, consider a workflow that does the following:

  1. The Customer Datastore node generates example data:

         1
          2
          3
          4
          5

# flow-logic/error-handling/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/error-handling.md "Edit this page")

# Error handling#

When designing your flow logic, it's a good practice to consider potential errors, and set up methods to handle them gracefully. With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.

Investigating errors

To investigate failed executions, you can:

  * Review your [Executions](../../workflows/executions/), for a [single workflow](../../workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) or [all workflows you have access to](../../workflows/executions/all-executions/). You can [load data from previous execution](../../workflows/executions/debug/) into your current workflow.
  * Enable [Log streaming](../../log-streaming/).

## Create and set an error workflow#

For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).

You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.

  1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
  2. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
  3. Select **Save**.
  4. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
     1. Select **Options** ![Options menu icon](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Settings**.
     2. In **Error workflow** , select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
     3. Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

## Error data#

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7

---|---

All information is always present, except:

  * `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
  * `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
  * `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error#

When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.

You can add the [Stop And Error](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.

# Code in n8n#

n8n is a low-code tool. This means you can do a lot without code, then add code when needed.

## Code in your workflows#

There are two places in your workflows where you can use code:

  * **Expressions**

Use [expressions](../glossary/#expression-n8n) to transform [data](../data/) in your nodes. You can use JavaScript in expressions, as well as n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](builtin/overview/) and [Data transformation functions](builtin/data-transformation-functions/).

[ Expressions](expressions/)

  * **Code node**

Use the Code node to add JavaScript or Python to your workflow.

[ Code node](code-node/)

## Other technical resources#

These are features that are relevant to technical users.

### Technical nodes#

n8n provides core nodes, which simplify adding key functionality such as API requests, webhooks, scheduling, and file handling.

  * **Write a backend**

The [HTTP Request](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/), [Webhook](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/), and [Code](code-node/) nodes help you make API calls, respond to webhooks, and write any JavaScript in your workflow.

Use this do things like [Create an API endpoint](https://n8n.io/workflows/1750-creating-an-api-endpoint/).

[ Core nodes](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/)

  * **Represent complex logic**

You can build complex flows, using nodes like [If](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), [Switch](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/), and [Merge](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) nodes.

[ Flow logic](../flow-logic/)

### Other developer resources#

  * **The n8n API**

n8n provides an API, where you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. There's an [n8n API node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

[ API](../api/)

  * **Self-host**

You can self-host n8n. This keeps your data on your own infrastructure.

[ Hosting](../hosting/)

  * **Build your own nodes**

You can build custom nodes, install them on your n8n instance, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

# integrations/community-nodes/installation/manual-install/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/community-nodes/installation/manual-install.md "Edit this page")

# Manually install community nodes from npm#

You can manually install community nodes from the npm registry on self-hosted n8n.

You need to manually install community nodes in the following circumstances:

  * Your n8n instance runs in queue mode.
  * You want to install [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-private-packages).

## Install a community node#

Access your Docker shell:

    1

|

    docker exec -it n8n sh

---|---

Create `~/.n8n/nodes` if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:

    1
    2

|

    mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
    cd ~/.n8n/nodes

---|---

Install the node:

    1

|

    npm i n8n-nodes-nodeName

---|---

Then restart n8n.

## Uninstall a community node#

Access your Docker shell:

    1

|

    docker exec -it n8n sh

---|---

Run npm uninstall:

    1

|

    npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName

---|---

## Upgrade a community node#

Breaking changes in versions

Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can downgrade.

### Upgrade to the latest version#

Access your Docker shell:

    1

|

    docker exec -it n8n sh

---|---

Run npm update:

    1

|

    npm update n8n-nodes-nodeName

---|---

### Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version#

Access your Docker shell:

    1

|

    docker exec -it n8n sh

---|---

Run npm uninstall to remove the current version:

    1

|

    npm uninstall n8n-nodes-nodeName

---|---

Run npm install with the version specified:

    1
    2

|

    # Replace 2.1.0 with your version number
    npm install n8n-nodes-nodeName@2.1.0

# LangChain learning resources#

You don't need to know details about LangChain to use n8n, but it can be helpful to learn a few concepts. This pages lists some learning resources that people at n8n have found helpful.

The [LangChain documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) includes introductions to key concepts and possible use cases. Choose the [LangChain | Python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) or [LangChain | JavaScript](https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction/) documentation for quickstarts, code examples, and API documentation. LangChain also provide [code templates](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/cookbook) (Python only), offering ideas for potential use cases and common patterns.

[What Product People Need To Know About LangChain](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/langchain-guide) provides a list of terminology and concepts, explained with helpful metaphors. Aimed at a wide audience.

If you prefer video, this [YouTube series by Greg Kamradt](https://youtu.be/_v_fgW2SkkQ?si=8Z2tfAoXnN3lXU9s) works through the LangChain documentation, providing code examples as it goes.

n8n offers space to discuss LangChain on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/bAt54txhHg). Join to share your projects and discuss ideas with the community.

# integrations/community-nodes/troubleshooting/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/community-nodes/troubleshooting.md "Edit this page")

# Troubleshooting and errors#

## Error: Missing packages#

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

  * Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](../../../hosting/installation/docker/) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
  * Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.

## Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud#

If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) > **Manage** and toggle **Disable all community nodes** to **`true`**. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.

# What's memory in AI?#

Memory is a key part of AI chat services. The [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) keeps a history of previous messages, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.

## AI memory in n8n#

To add memory to your AI workflow you can use either:

  * [Simple Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/): stores a customizable length of chat history for the current session. This is the easiest to get started with.
  * One of the memory services that n8n provides nodes for. These include:
    * [Motorhead](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)
    * [Redis Chat Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryredischat/)
    * [Postgres Chat Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat/)
    * [Xata](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryxata/)
    * [Zep](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)

If you need to do advanced AI memory management in your workflows, use the [Chat Memory Manager](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node.

This node is useful when you:

  * Can't add a memory node directly.
  * Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed.
  * Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context.

# LangChain concepts in n8n#

This page explains how LangChain concepts and features map to n8n nodes.

This page includes lists of the LangChain-focused nodes in n8n. You can use any n8n node in a workflow where you interact with LangChain, to link LangChain to other services. The LangChain features uses n8n's [Cluster nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/).

n8n implements LangChain JS

This feature is n8n's implementation of [LangChain's JavaScript framework](https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction).

## Trigger nodes#

[Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/)

## Cluster nodes#

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](../../../_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)

### Root nodes#

Each cluster starts with one [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n).

#### Chains#

A [chain](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) is a series of LLMs, and related tools, linked together to support functionality that can't be provided by a single LLM alone.

Available nodes:

  * [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/)
  * [Retrieval Q&A Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/)
  * [Summarization Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/)
  * [Sentiment Analysis](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.sentimentanalysis/)
  * [Text Classifier](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/)

Learn more about [chaining in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel).

#### Agents#

> An [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) has access to a suite of tools, and determines which ones to use depending on the user input. Agents can use multiple tools, and use the output of one tool as the input to the next. [Source](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/def3a26c054575e1ed40b9062087e8c0a8899633/docs/core_docs/docs/modules/agents/index.mdx)

Available nodes:

  * [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)

Learn more about [Agents in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/agents).

#### Vector stores#

[Vector stores](../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) store embedded data, and perform vector searches on it.

  * [Simple Vector Store](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreinmemory/)
  * [PGVector Vector Store](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepgvector/)
  * [Pinecone Vector Store](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/)

Learn more about [Vector stores in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/vectorstores/).

#### Miscellaneous#

Utility nodes.

[LangChain Code](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/): import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it.

### Sub-nodes#

Each root node can have one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) attached to it.

#### Document loaders#

Document loaders add data to your chain as documents. The data source can be a file or web service.

Available nodes:

  * [Default Document Loader](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/)
  * [GitHub Document Loader](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader/)

Learn more about [Document loaders in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/document_loaders).

#### Language models#

[LLMs (large language models)](../../../glossary/#large-language-model-llm) are programs that analyze datasets. They're the key element of working with AI.

Learn more about [Language models in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models).

#### Memory#

[Memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) retains information about previous queries in a series of queries. For example, when a user interacts with a chat model, it's useful if your application can remember and call on the full conversation, not just the most recent query entered by the user.

Available nodes:

  * [Motorhead](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)

# Data structure#

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. It has the following structure:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

    24

|

    [
    	{
    		// For most data:
    		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json'
    		"json": {
    			// Example data
    			"apple": "beets",
    			"carrot": {
    				"dill": 1
    			}
    		},
    		// For binary data:
    		// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary'
    		"binary": {
    			// Example data
    			"apple-picture": {
    				"data": "....", // Base64 encoded binary data (required)
    				"mimeType": "image/png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
    				"fileExtension": "png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
    				"fileName": "example.png", // Best practice to set if possible (optional)
    			}
    		}
    	},
    ]

---|---

Skipping the `json` key and array syntax

From 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the `json` key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array (`[]`) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the `json` key.

## Data item processing#

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8

|

    [
    	{
    		name-input-value: "test1"
    	},
    	{
    		name-input-value: "test2"
    	}
    ]

# integrations/builtin/credentials/s3/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/s3.md "Edit this page")

# S3 credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [S3](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.s3/)

## Prerequisites#

Create an account on an S3-compatible server. Use the S3 node for generic or non-AWS S3 like:

  * [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)
  * [MinIO](https://min.io/)
  * [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * S3 endpoint

## Related resources#

Refer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction) or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/).

## Using S3 endpoint#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **S3 Endpoint** : Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.
  * A **Region** : Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the "region slug."
  * An **Access Key ID** : Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.
  * A **Secret Access Key** : Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.
  * **Force Path Style** : When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.
  * **Ignore SSL Issues** : When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information.

### Using DigitalOcean Spaces#

To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:

  1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.
     * Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
  2. For the **Region** , enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.
     * If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.
  3. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces).
  4. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.
  5. Select **Generate New Key**.
  6. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.
  7. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.
  8. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.
     * Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys) for more information on generating the key and secret.
  9. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
  10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
     * To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
     * To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/) for more information.

### Using Wasabi#

To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:

  1. For the **S3 Endpoint** , enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.
     * Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions) to identify the correct URL.
  2. For the **Region** , enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint** , `us-east-2` is the region.
  3. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
  4. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.
  5. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.
  6. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.
  7. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.
  8. Copy the **Secret Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Secret Access Key**.
     * Refer to [Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019677192-Creating-a-Wasabi-API-Access-Key-Set) for more information on generating the key and secret.
  9. Wasabi recommends turning on the **Force Path Style** toggle "because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues." Refer to the Wasabi [REST API Introduction](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction) for more information.
  10. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
     * To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
     * To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

# Mapping in the expressions editor#

These examples show how to access linked items in the expressions editor. Refer to [expressions](../../../code/expressions/) for more information on expressions, including built in variables and methods.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](../data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## Access the linked item in a previous node's output#

When you use this, n8n works back up the item linking chain, to find the parent item in the given node.

    1
    2

|

    // Returns the linked item
    {{$("<node-name>").item}}

---|---

As a longer example, consider a scenario where a node earlier in the workflow has the following output data:

To extract the name, use the following expression:

    1

|

    {{$("<node-name>").item.json.name}}

---|---

### Access the linked item in the current node's input#

In this case, the item linking is within the node: find the input item that the node links to an output item.

    1
    2

    // Returns the linked item
    {{$input.item}}

        "name": "Edmund Pevensie",
      }
    ]

# Basic LLM Chain node#

Use the Basic LLM Chain node to set the prompt that the model will use along with setting an optional parser for the response.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Basic LLM Chain node and links to more resources.

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Basic LLM Chain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/basic-llm-chain/) page.

## Node parameters#

### Prompt#

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

  * **Take from previous node automatically** : If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
  * **Define below** : If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format#

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

  * [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
  * [Item List Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
  * [Structured Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Chat Messages#

Use **Chat Messages** when you're using a chat model to set a message.

n8n ignores these options if you don't connect a chat model. Select the **Type Name or ID** you want the node to use:

#### AI#

Enter a sample expected response in the **Message** field. The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.

#### System#

Enter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.

Use this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.

#### User#

Enter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.

Select one of these input types:

  * **Text** : Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.
  * **Image (Binary)** : Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.
  * **Image (URL)** : Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.

For both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:

  * **Auto** : The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.
  * **Low** : The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.
  * **High** : The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

## Common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the Basic LLM Chain node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### No prompt specified error#

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this error in one of two scenarios:

  1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and haven't entered anything in the **Text** field.
     * To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
  2. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has no field called `chatInput`.
     * The node expects the `chatInput` field. If your previous node doesn't have this field, add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data.md "Edit this page")

# Check incoming data#

At times, you may want to check the incoming data. If the incoming data doesn't match a condition, you may want to return a different value. For example, you want to check if a variable from the previous node is empty and return a string if it's empty. Use the following code snippet to return `not found` if the variable is empty.

    1

|

    {{$json["variable_name"]? $json["variable_name"] :"not found"}}

---|---

The above expression uses the ternary operator. You can learn more about the ternary operator [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

As an alternative, you can use the [nullish coalescing operator (??)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) or the [logical or operator (||)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR):

    1
    2

|

    {{ $x ?? "default value" }}
    {{ $x || "default value" }}

---|---

In either of the above two cases, the value of `$x` will be used if it's set to a non-null, non-false value. The string `default value` is the fallback value.

# integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoresupabase/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoresupabase.md "Edit this page")

# Supabase Vector Store node#

Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Supabase node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/supabase/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Supabase provides a [quickstart for setting up your vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql). If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing.

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the Supabase Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents#

You can use the Supabase Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Supabase Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the Supabase Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Supabase Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Supabase Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Supabase Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Supabase Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Supabase Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector store.

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)** , and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents#

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Table Name** : Enter the Supabase table to use.
  * **Prompt** : Enter the search query.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Table Name** : Enter the Supabase table to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters#

  * **Table Name** : Enter the Supabase table to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Table Name** : Enter the Supabase table to use.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Update Documents#

  * **Table Name** : Enter the Supabase table to use.
  * **ID** : The ID of an embedding entry.

## Node options#

### Query Name#

The name of the matching function you set up in Supabase. If you follow the [Supabase quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql), this will be `match_documents`.

### Metadata Filter#

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

# Chat Trigger node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Chat Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node#

When [embedding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.

To do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    createChat({
    	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
    	metadata: {
    		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
    	};
    });

---|---

The `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's [data processing features](../../../../../data/).

## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages#

When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.

In Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory** , it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](../#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:

  1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
  2. Attach a **Simple Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.
  3. Attach the same **Simple Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.
  4. In the **Simple Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.

One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.

If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

# data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts.md "Edit this page")

# Item linking concepts#

Each output item created by a node includes metadata that links them to the input item (or items) that the node used to generate them. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node.

This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:

  * [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.
  * [Item linking in the Code node](../item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.
  * [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.

## n8n's automatic item linking#

If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:

  * Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
  * Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
  * Multiple inputs and outputs:
    * If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
    * If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
    * If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.

If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/) for more information.

## Item linking example#

![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](../../../../_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)

In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.

The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:

  * [Mapping in the UI](../../data-mapping-ui/)
  * [Mapping in the expressions editor](../../data-mapping-expressions/)
  * [Item linking in the Code node](../item-linking-code-node/)
  * [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/)

# Troubleshooting SAML SSO#

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

  * Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
  * Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
  * Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.

For more support, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/), or contact your support representative if you have a paid support plan.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/structure.md "Edit this page")

# Structure of the node base file#

The node base file follows this basic structure:

  1. Add import statements.
  2. Create a class for the node.
  3. Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.

A programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `properties` object, within `descriptions`.

## Outline structure for a declarative-style node#

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/server-setups/docker-compose.md "Edit this page")

# Docker-Compose#

If you have already installed Docker and Docker-Compose, then you can start with step 3.

You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## 1\. Install Docker and Docker Compose#

How you install Docker and Docker Compose can vary depending on the Linux distribution you use. You can find detailed instructions in both the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installation documentation. The following example is for Ubuntu:

    # Update and install Docker and Docker Compose
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

---|---

Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are available by typing:

    1
    2

|

    docker --version
    docker compose version

---|---

## 2\. Optional: Non-root user access#

You can optionally grant access to run Docker without the `sudo` command.

To grant access to the user that you're currently logged in with (assuming they have `sudo` access), run:

    1
    2
    3

|

    sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
    # Register the `docker` group memebership with current session without changing your primary group
    exec sg docker newgrp

---|---

To grant access to a different user, type the following, substituting `<USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>` with the appropriate username:

    1

|

    sudo usermod -aG docker <USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>

---|---

You will need to run `exec sg docker newgrp` from any of that user's existing sessions for it to access the new group permissions.

You can verify that your current session recognizes the `docker` group by typing:

    1

|

    groups

---|---

## 3\. DNS setup#

To host n8n online or on a network, create a dedicated subdomain pointed at your server.

Add an A record to route the subdomain accordingly:

  * **Type** : A
  * **Name** : `n8n` (or the desired subdomain)
  * **IP address** : (your server's IP address)

## 4\. Create an `.env` file#

Create a project directory to store your n8n environment configuration and Docker Compose files and navigate inside:

    1
    2

|

    mkdir n8n-compose
    cd n8n-compose

---|---

Inside the `n8n-compose` directory, create an `.env` file to customize your n8n instance's details. Change it to match your own information:

.env file

    15

|

    # DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN together determine where n8n will be reachable from
    # The top level domain to serve from
    DOMAIN_NAME=example.com

    # The subdomain to serve from
    SUBDOMAIN=n8n

    # The above example serve n8n at: https://n8n.example.com

    # Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron and other scheduling nodes
    # New York is the default value if not set
    GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin

    # The email address to use for the TLS/SSL certificate creation
    SSL_EMAIL=user@example.com

## 5\. Create local files directory#

Inside your project directory, create a directory called `local-files` for sharing files between the n8n instance and the host system (for example, using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)):

    1

|

    mkdir local-files

---|---

The Docker Compose file below can automatically create this directory, but doing it manually ensures that it's created with the right ownership and permissions.

## 6\. Create Docker Compose file#

Create a `compose.yaml` file. Paste the following in the file:

compose.yaml file

    volumes:
      n8n_data:
      traefik_data:

The above Docker Compose file configures two containers: one for n8n, and one to run [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), an application proxy to manage TLS/SSL certificates and handle routing.

It also creates and mounts two [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) and mounts the `local-files` directory you created earlier:

Name | Type | Container mount | Description
---|---|---|---
`n8n_data` | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) | `/home/node/.n8n` | Where n8n saves its SQLite database file and encryption key.
`traefik_data` | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) | `/letsencrypt` | Where traefik saves the TLS/SSL certificate data.
`./local-files` | [Bind](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) | `/files` | A local directory shared between the n8n instance and host. In n8n, use the `/files` path to read from and write to this directory.

## 7\. Start Docker Compose#

You can now start n8n by typing:

    1

|

    sudo docker compose up -d

---|---

To stop the container, type:

    1

|

    sudo docker compose stop

---|---

## 8\. Done#

You can now reach n8n using the subdomain + domain combination you defined in your `.env` file configuration. The above example would result in `https://n8n.example.com`.

n8n is only accessible using secure HTTPS, not over plain HTTP.

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort.md "Edit this page")

# Sort#

Use the Sort node to organize lists of items in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

Array sort behavior

The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) to learn more.

## Node parameters#

Configure this node using the **Type** parameter.

Use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting from these options.

### Simple#

Performs an ascending or descending sort using the selected fields.

When you select this **Type** :

  * Use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the **Field Name**.
  * Select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.

#### Simple options#

When you select **Simple** as the **Type** , you have the option to **Disable Dot Notation**. By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

### Random#

Creates a random order in the list.

### Code#

Input custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation. This is a good option if a simple sort won't meet your needs.

Enter your custom JavaScript code in the **Code** input field.

# Cohere Model node#

Use the Cohere Model node to use Cohere's models.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Cohere Model node, and links to more resources.

This node lacks tools support, so it won't work with the [AI Agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node. Instead, connect it with the [Basic LLM Chain](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) node.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node Options#

  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/mqtt/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/mqtt.md "Edit this page")

# MQTT credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [MQTT](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt/)
  * [MQTT Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger/)

## Prerequisites#

Install an [MQTT broker](https://mqtt.org/).

MQTT provides a list of Servers/Brokers at [MQTT Software](https://mqtt.org/software/).

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Broker connection

## Related resources#

Refer to [MQTT's documentation](https://mqtt.org/) for more information about the MQTT protocol.

Refer to your broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration and details.

## Using broker connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**
  * The **Host**
  * The **Port**
  * A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with
  * If you're using **SSL** , the relevant certificates and keys

To set things up:

  1. Select the broker's **Protocol** , which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
     * **Mqtt** : Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.
     * **Mqtts** : Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.
     * **Ws** : Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.
  2. Enter your broker **Host**.
  3. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
  4. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.
  5. Enter that user's **Password**.
  6. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.
  7. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
     * Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.
  8. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:
     1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
        1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate** : If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
        2. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.
        3. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.
     2. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.

Refer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/github.md "Edit this page")

# GitHub credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [GitHub](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/)
  * [GitHub Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger/)
  * [GitHub Document Loader](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader/): this node doesn't support OAuth.

## Prerequisites#

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token: Use this method with any GitHub nodes.
  * OAuth2: Use this method with [GitHub](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/) and [GitHub Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger/) nodes only; don't use with [GitHub Document Loader](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader/).

## Related resources#

Refer to [GitHub's API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

There are two steps to setting up this credential:

  1. Generate a GitHub personal access token.
  2. Set up the credential.

Refer to the sections below for detailed instructions.

### Generate personal access token#

Recommended access token type

n8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.

To generate your personal access token:

  1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) for more information.
  2. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
  3. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
  4. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens** , select **Tokens (classic)**.
  5. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.
  6. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.
  7. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.
  8. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.
     * A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.
     * Refer to
  9. Select **Generate token**.
  10. Copy the token.

Refer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) for more information on GitHub scopes.

### Set up the credential#

Then, in your n8n credential:

  1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.
     * If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server), update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.
  2. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.
  3. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.

## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](../../../../hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps):

  1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
  2. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
  3. In the left navigation, select **OAuth apps**.
  4. Select **New OAuth App**.
     * If you haven't created an app before, you may see **Register a new application** instead. Select it.
  5. Enter an **Application name** , like `n8n integration`.
  6. Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app's website.
  7. If you'd like, add the optional **Application description** , which GitHub displays to end-users.
  8. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the GitHub **Authorization callback URL**.
  9. Select **Register application**.
  10. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** this generates and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to the [GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) for more information on the authorization process.

# `getWorkflowStaticData(type)`#

This gives access to the static workflow data.

Experimental feature

  * Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a [trigger](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) or webhook to save static data.
  * This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.

You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.

As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data has changed and saves it, if necessary.

There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.

Example with global data:

JavaScriptPython

    // Get the global workflow static data
    const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');

    // Access its data
    const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;

    // Update its data
    workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();

    // Delete data
    delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution;

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait.md "Edit this page")

# Wait#

Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.

## Operations#

The Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:

  * **After Time Interval**: The node waits for a certain amount of time.
  * **At Specified Time**: The node waits until a specific time.
  * **On Webhook Call**: The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
  * **On Form Submitted**: The node waits until it receives a form submission.

Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.

### After Time Interval#

Wait for a certain amount of time.

This parameter includes two more fields:

  * **Wait Amount** : Enter the amount of time to wait.
  * **Wait Unit** : Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:
    * **Seconds**
    * **Minutes**
    * **Hours**
    * **Days**

Refer to Time-based operations for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.

### At Specified Time#

Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.

Refer to Time-based operations for more detail on the timezone used.

### On Webhook Call#

This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.

The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.

When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.

For this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.

#### Authentication#

Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:

  * **Basic Auth** : Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.
  * **Header Auth** : Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.
  * **JWT Auth** : Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.
  * **None** : Don't use authentication.

Auth reference

Refer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#supported-authentication-methods) for more information on each auth type.

#### HTTP Method#

Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.

#### Response Code#

Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.

#### Respond#

Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:

  * **Immediately** : Respond as soon as the node executes.
  * **When Last Node Finishes** : Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:
    * **Response Data** : Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:
      * **All Entries** : Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
      * **First Entry JSON** : Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
      * **First Entry Binary** : Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
      * **No Response Body** : Return with no body.
  * **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node** : Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

#### Limit Wait Time#

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:

  * **Limit Type** : Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
    * **After Time Interval** : Wait for a certain amount of time.
      * Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
      * Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
    * **At Specified Time** : Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
      * **Max Date and Time** : Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Webhook Call options#

  * **Binary Property** : Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.
  * **Ignore Bots** : Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **IP(s) Whitelist** : Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.
  * **No Response Body** : Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
  * **Raw Body** : Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Response Data** : Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
  * **Response Headers** : Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
  * **Webhook Suffix** : Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

#### On Webhook Call limitations#

There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:

  * Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

### On Form Submitted#

Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

#### Form Title#

Enter the title to display at the top of the form.

#### Form Description#

Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

#### Form Fields#

Set up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:

  * **Field Label** : Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.
  * **Field Type** : Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:
    * **Date**
    * **Dropdown List** : Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.
      * **Multiple Choice** : Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)
    * **Number**
    * **Password**
    * **Text**
    * **Textarea**
  * **Required Field** : Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).

#### Respond When#

Set when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:

  * **Form Is Submitted** : Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.
  * **Workflow Finishes** : Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.
  * **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node** : Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.

#### Limit Wait Time#

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).

If turned on, also set: * **Limit Type** : Select what type of limit to enforce from these options: * **After Time Interval** : Wait for a certain amount of time. * Enter the limit's **Amount** of time. * Select the limit's **Unit** of time. * **At Specified Time** : Wait until a specific date and time to resume. * **Max Date and Time** : Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Form Response options#

  * **Form Response** : Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:
    * **Form Submitted Text** : The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
    * **Redirect URL** : The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
  * **Webhook Suffix** : Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

## Time-based operations#

For the time-based resume operations, note that:

  * For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
  * The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.

# Google Sheets Trigger node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event#

When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers#

Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.

The [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).

To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added** :

  1. Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
  2. Select **Add option**.
  3. Select **DateTime Render**.
  4. Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.

The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.

The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value.

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable#

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation#

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation#

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:

  1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
  2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
  3. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
  4. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/server-setups/aws.md "Edit this page")

# Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services#

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Hosting options#

AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

## Prerequisites#

The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io).

While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Create a cluster#

Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:

    1

|

    eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>

---|---

This can take a while to create the cluster.

Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.

## Clone configuration repository#

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/aws). The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

    1

|

    git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b aws

---|---

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

    1

|

    cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting

---|---

## Configure Postgres#

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage#

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/general-purpose.html#EBSVolumeTypes_gp2), is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claaim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    …
    spec:
      storageClassName: gp2
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
    …

---|---

### Postgres environment variables#

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n#

### Create a volume for file storage#

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    …
    volumes:
      - name: n8n-claim0
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: n8n-claim0
    …

---|---

### Pod resources#

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    …
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "250Mi"
      limits:
        memory: "500Mi"
    …

---|---

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

  * **Start** : 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
  * **Pro (10k executions)** : 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
  * **Pro (50k executions)** : 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables#

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments#

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

  * Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
  * Define the container image to use
  * Set resource consumption limits
  * The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
  * Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services#

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster#

Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:

    1

|

    kubectl apply -f .

---|---

Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

---|---

## Set up DNS#

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.

To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:

  1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.
  2. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.
  3. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.
  4. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.

Use HTTP

This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an "HTTPS" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.

## Delete resources#

If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl delete -f .

---|---

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# workflows/export-import/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/workflows/export-import.md "Edit this page")

# Export and import workflows#

n8n saves workflows in JSON format. You can export your workflows as JSON files or import JSON files into your n8n library. You can export and import workflows in several ways.

Sharing credentials

Exported workflow JSON files include [credential](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.

## Copy-Paste#

You can copy and paste a workflow or parts of it by selecting the nodes you want to copy to the clipboard (`Ctrl + c` or `cmd +c`) and pasting it (`Ctrl + v` or `cmd + v`) into the Editor UI.

To select all nodes or a group of nodes, click and drag: ![Select a group of nodes](../../_images/workflows/export-import/selectingnodes.gif)

## From the Editor UI menu#

From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right ![Workflow menu icon](/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) to see the following options:

![Import/Export menu](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-six/l1-c6-import-export-menu.png)_Import & Export workflows menu_

  * **Download** : Downloads your current workflow as a JSON file to your computer.
  * **Import from URL** : Imports workflow JSON from a URL, for example, [this workflow JSON file on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/demo-setup/main/n8n/backup/workflows/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb.json).
  * **Import from File** : Imports a workflow as a JSON file from your computer.

## From the command line#

  * Export: See the [full list of commands ](../../hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) for exporting workflows or credentials.
  * Import: See the [full list of commands ](../../hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials) for importing workflows or credentials.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md "Edit this page")

# HTTP Request credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
  * [HTTP Request Tool (legacy)](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/)

## Prerequisites#

You must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.

If you need to secure the authentication with an SSL certificate, refer to Provide an SSL certificate for the information you'll need.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Predefined credential type
  * Basic auth (generic credential type)
  * Custom auth (generic credential type)
  * Digest auth (generic credential type)
  * Header auth (generic credential type)
  * Bearer auth (generic credential type)
  * OAuth1 (generic credential type)
  * OAuth2 (generic credential type)
  * Query auth (generic credential type)

Refer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) for more information relating to generic credential types.

Predefined credential types

n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

You can use [Predefined credential types](../../../custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using predefined credential type#

To use a predefined credential type:

  1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
  2. In **Authentication** , select **Predefined Credential Type**.
  3. In **Credential Type** , select the API you want to use.
  4. In **Credential for`<API name>`**, you can:
     1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
     2. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using basic auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
  * The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using digest auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
  * The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using header auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
  * The **Value** for the header

Read more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication)

## Using bearer auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports bearer authentication. This authentication type is actually just header authentication with the `Name` set to `Authorization` and the `Value` set to `Bearer <token>`.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * The **Bearer Token** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting

Read more about [bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).

## Using OAuth1#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

  * An **Authorization URL** : Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
  * An **Access Token URL** : This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.
  * A **Consumer Key** : Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.
  * A **Consumer Secret** : Also known as the client secret, like a password.
  * A **Request Token URL** : This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.
  * Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:
    * **HMAC-SHA1**
    * **HMAC-SHA256**
    * **HMAC-SHA512**

For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html).

## Using OAuth2#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.

For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

### Authorization Code grant type#

Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

  * An **Authorization URL**
  * An **Access Token URL**
  * A **Client ID** : The ID or username to log in with.
  * A **Client Secret** : The secret or password used to log in with.
  * _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope** s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
  * _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
  * An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
    * **Header** : Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
    * **Body** : Send the credentials in the body of the request.
  * _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### Client Credentials grant type#

Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

  * An **Access Token URL** : The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.
  * A **Client ID** : The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
  * A **Client Secret** : The secret or password used to log in to the client.
  * _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope** s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
  * An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
    * **Header** : Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
    * **Body** : Send the credentials in the body of the request.
  * _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### PKCE grant type#

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

To configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.

Then enter:

  * An **Authorization URL**
  * An **Access Token URL**
  * A **Client ID** : The ID or username to log in with.
  * A **Client Secret** : The secret or password used to log in with.
  * _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope** s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
  * _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
  * An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
    * **Header** : Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
    * **Body** : Send the credentials in the body of the request.
  * _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

## Using query auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use Custom Auth.)

To configure this credential, enter:

  * A query parameter key or **Name**
  * A query parameter **Value**

## Using custom auth#

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.

The **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.

### Sending two headers#

    		"apikey": "my-api-key"
    	}
    }

---|---

## Provide an SSL certificate#

You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:

  1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings** , turn on **SSL Certificates**.
  2. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.

To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:

  * The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle
  * The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
  * The **Private Key** (KEY)
  * _Optional:_ If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.

If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:

  * Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**
  * Enter the **Private Key** /KEY in that field

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/examples/understand-agents.md "Edit this page")

# What's an agent in AI?#

One way to think of an [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is as a [chain](../understand-chains/) that knows how to make decisions. Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.

Agents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool). When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.

## Agents in n8n#

n8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.

When execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user.

Password compatibility

If you try a password credential and it doesn't work for a specific node function, try switching to an API key. Odoo requires an API key for certain modules or based on certain settings.

## Required plan type#

Required plan type

Access to the external API is only available on a **Custom** Odoo plan. (The One App Free or Standard plans won't give you access.)

Refer to [Odoo Pricing Plans](https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan) for more information.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/cloud-setup.md "Edit this page")

# Set up user management on n8n Cloud#

To access user management, upgrade to version 0.195.0 or newer.

Irreversible upgrade

Once you upgrade your Cloud instance to an n8n version with user management, you can't downgrade your version.

## Step one: In-app setup#

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

  1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
  2. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
  3. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.

## Step two: Invite users#

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.

  1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)
  2. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
  3. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
  4. Click **Invite**.
  5. Enter the new user's email address.
  6. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.

## Fetch issues for a specific project#

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

  * Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
  * Toggle **Return All** to true.
  * Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
  * Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.

# data/data-flow-nodes/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-flow-nodes.md "Edit this page")

# Data flow within nodes#

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8

|

    [
    	{
    		name-input-value: "test1"
    	},
    	{
    		name-input-value: "test2"
    	}

# Discord node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Discord node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add extra fields to embeds#

Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.

The Discord node supports embeds when using the **Send** operation on the **Message** resource. Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.

To add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.

For example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

    {
        "author": "My Name",
    	"url": "https://discord.js.org",
    	"fields": [
    		{
    			"name": "Regular field title",
    			"value": "Some value here"
    		}
    	],
    	"footer": {
    		"text": "Some footer text here",
    		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
    	}
    }

---|---

You can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).

If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:

    1

|

    https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages

---|---

In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:

    	]
    }

## Mention users and channels#

To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.

You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:

  * **User** : `<@USER_ID>`
  * **Channel** : `<#CHANNEL_ID>`
  * **Role** : `<@&ROLE_ID>`

# hosting/scaling/external-storage/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/external-storage.md "Edit this page")

# External storage#

Feature availability

  * Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans
  * If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

n8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data.

n8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.

## Storing n8n's binary data in S3#

n8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.

Enterprise-tier feature

You will need an [Enterprise license key](../../../license-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.

### Setup#

Create and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11

|

    {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
      {
       "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": ["s3:*"],
       "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>", "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"]
      }
     ]
    }

---|---

Set a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.

Once you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:

    1
    2
    3

    export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=...
    export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=...
    export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=...
    export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=...

---|---

No region

If your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`.

Tell n8n to store binary data in S3:

    1
    2

|

    export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3
    export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3

---|---

Auth autodetection

To automatically detect credentials to authenticate your S3 calls, set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_AUTH_AUTO_DETECT` to `true`. This will use the default [credential provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html#credchain).

Restart the server to load the new configuration.

### Usage#

After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:

    1

|

    workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}

---|---

n8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.

If you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.

Binary data pruning

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

# hosting/scaling/queue-mode/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md "Edit this page")

# Queue mode#

You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.

Binary data storage

n8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage in filesystem. If your workflows need to persist binary data in queue mode, you can use [S3 external storage](../external-storage/).

## How it works#

When running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions.

Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second).

By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.

This is the process flow:

  1. The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution.
  2. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, Redis, which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.
  3. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.
  4. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.
  5. After completing the workflow execution, the worker:
     * Writes the results to the database.
     * Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.
  6. Redis notifies the main instance.

!["Diagram showing the flow of data between the main n8n instance, Redis, the n8n workers, and the n8n database"](../../../_images/hosting/scaling/queue-mode-flow.png)

## Configuring workers#

Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.

### Set encryption key#

n8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.

The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.

Set the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:

    1

|

    export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>

---|---

### Set executions mode#

Database considerations

n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.

Set the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` on the main instance and any workers using the following command.

    1

|

    export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue

---|---

Alternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](../../configuration/environment-variables/).

### Start Redis#

Running Redis on a separate machine

You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.

To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:

Run the following command to start a Redis instance:

    1

|

    docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379  -d redis

---|---

By default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.

Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description
---|---|---
`queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`.
`queue.bull.redis.port:6379` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379` | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value.

You can also set the following optional configurations:

Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description
---|---|---
`queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME` | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable.
`queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD` | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable.
`queue.bull.redis.db:0` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB` | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration.
`queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms).
`queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30` | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds.

Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.

### Start workers#

You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.

Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:

    1

|

    ./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker

---|---

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

    1

|

    docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker

---|---

You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.

#### Worker server#

Each worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:

  * `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
  * `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
  * [credentials overwrite endpoint](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)
  * [`/metrics`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)

#### View running workers#

Feature availability

  * Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
  * If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

You can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.

## Running n8n with queues#

When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency.

Redis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.

Migrate data

If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](../../cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.

## Webhook processors#

Keep in mind

Webhook processes rely on Redis and need the `EXECUTIONS_MODE` environment variable set too. Follow the configure the workers section above to setup webhook processor nodes.

Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.

This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.

n8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.

You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:

    1

|

    ./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook

---|---

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

    1

|

    docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 -e "EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue" docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook

---|---

### Configure webhook URL#

To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:

    1

|

    export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com

---|---

You can also set this value in the configuration file.

### Configure load balancer#

When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:

  * Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool
  * All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process

**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.

You can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.

### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)#

You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

    1

|

    export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true

---|---

When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.

## Configure worker concurrency#

You can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:

    1

|

    n8n worker --concurrency=5

---|---

## Concurrency and scaling recommendations#

n8n recommends setting concurrency to 5 or higher for your worker instances. Setting low concurrency values with a large numbers of workers can exhaust your database's connection pool, leading to processing delays and failures.

## Multi-main setup#

Feature availability

  * Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.

In queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.

In a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks:

  * **regular tasks** , such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and
  * **at-most-once tasks** , such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.

In a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:

  * **followers** , which run **regular tasks** , and
  * the **leader** , which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.

### Leader designation#

In a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.

### Configuring multi-main setup#

To deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure:

  * All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.
  * All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.
  * All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.
  * All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.

If needed, you can adjust the leader key options:

Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description
---|---|---
`multiMainSetup.ttl:10` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10` | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup.
`multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/rbac/projects.md "Edit this page")

# Projects

Feature availability

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

n8n uses projects to group workflows and [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), and assigns [roles](../role-types/) to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access.

## Create a project#

Instance owners and instance admins can create projects.

To create a project:

  1. Select ![Plus icon](../../../_images/common-icons/plus.png) **Add project**.
  2. Fill out the project settings.
  3. Select **Save**.

## Add and remove users in a project#

Project admins can add and remove users.

To add a user to a project:

  1. Select the project.
  2. Select **Project settings**.
  3. Under **Project members** , browse for users or search by username or email address.
  4. Select the user you want to add.
  5. Check the [role type](../role-types/) and change it if needed.
  6. Select **Save**.

To remove a user from a project:

  1. Select the project.
  2. Select **Project settings**.
  3. In the role type dropdown for the user you want to remove, select **Remove access**.
  4. Select **Save**.

## Delete a project#

To delete a project:

  1. Select the project.
  2. Select **Project settings**.
  3. Select **Delete project**.
  4. Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
     * **Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project** : n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
     * **Delete its workflows and credentials** : n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.

## Move workflows and credentials between projects or users#

Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.

Moving revokes sharing

Moving workflows or credentials removes all existing sharing. Be aware that this could impact other workflows currently sharing these resources.

  1. Select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) or **Credential menu** ![Workflow menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Move**.

Moving workflows with credentials

When moving a workflow with credentials you have permission to share, you can choose to share the credentials as well. This ensures that the workflow continues to have access to the credentials it needs to execute. n8n will note any credentials that can't be moved (credentials you don't have permission to share).

  2. Select the project or user you want to move to.

  3. Select **Next**.
  4. Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.
  5. Select **Confirm move to new project**.

## Using external secrets in projects#

To use [external secrets](../../../external-secrets/) in a project, you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](../../account-types/) as a member of the project.

# flow-logic/looping/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/looping.md "Edit this page")

# Looping in n8n#

Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are some nodes where this isn't true.

## Using loops in n8n#

n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

![The Customer Datastore node output](../../_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:

  1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
  2. Configure the parameters.
  3. Execute the node.

You would receive five messages: one for each item.

This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.

### Executing nodes once#

For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.

## Creating loops#

n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to Node exceptions for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.

### Loop until a condition is met#

To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop.

Here is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:

![Editor UI view of sample workflow](../../_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)

### Loop until all items are processed#

Use the [Loop Over Items](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.

You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.

The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.

## Node exceptions#

Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:

  * [CrateDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
  * [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
  * [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.
  * [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
  * [Microsoft SQL](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
  * [MongoDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
  * [QuestDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.
  * [Redis](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):
    * Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
  * [RSS Read](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rssfeedread/) executes once for the requested URL.
  * [TimescaleDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.

# integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow.md "Edit this page")

# Call n8n Workflow Tool node#

The Call n8n Workflow Tool node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to run another n8n workflow and fetch its output data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Call n8n Workflow Tool node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

### Description#

Enter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

### Source#

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

  * **Database** to select the workflow from a list or enter a workflow ID.
  * **Define Below** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](../../../../../workflows/export-import/).

### Workflow Inputs#

When using **Database** as workflow source, once you choose a sub-workflow (and define the **Workflow Input Schema** in the sub-workflow), you can define the **Workflow Inputs**.

Select the **Refresh** button to pull in the input fields from the sub-workflow.

You can define the workflow input values using any combination of the following options:

  * providing fixed values
  * using expressions to reference data from the current workflow
  * [letting the AI model specify the parameter](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/) by selecting the button AI button on the right side of the field
  * using the [`$fromAI()` function](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/#use-the-fromai-function) in expressions to control the way the model fills in data and to mix AI generated input with other custom input

To reference data from the current workflow, drag fields from the input panel to the field with the Expressions mode selected.

To get started with the `$fromAI()` function, select the "Let the model define this parameter" button on the right side of the field and then use the **X** on the box to revert to user-defined values. The field will change to an expression field pre-populated with the `$fromAI()` expression. From here, you can customize the expression to add other static or dynamic content, or tweak the `$fromAI()` function parameters.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/baserow.md "Edit this page")

# Baserow credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following node:

  * [Baserow](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.baserow/)

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Baserow](https://baserow.io/) account on any hosted Baserow instance or a self-hosted instance.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Basic auth

## Related resources#

Refer to [Baserow's documentation](https://baserow.io/docs/index) for more information about the service.

Refer to [Baserow's auto-generated API documentation](https://baserow.io/api-docs) for more information about the API specifically.

## Using basic auth#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * Your Baserow **Host**
  * A **Username** and **Password** to log in with

Follow these steps:

  1. Enter the **Host** for the Baserow instance:
     * For a Baserow-hosted instance: leave as `https://api.baserow.io`.
     * For a self-hosted instance: set to your self-hosted instance API URL.
  2. Enter the **Username** for the user account n8n should use.
  3. Enter the **Password** for that user account.

Refer to [Baserow's API Authentication documentation](https://baserow.io/docs/apis/rest-api#authentication) for information on creating user accounts.

# Embeddings AWS Bedrock node#

Use the Embeddings AWS Bedrock node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings AWS Bedrock node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/aws/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

Learn more about available models in the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html).

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files.md "Edit this page")

# Credentials file#

The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.

In the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](../ui-elements/). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.

## Structure of the credentials file#

The credentials file follows this basic structure:

  1. Import statements
  2. Create a class for the credentials
  3. Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate.md "Edit this page")

# Aggregate#

Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

## Node parameters#

To begin using the node, select the **Aggregate** you'd like to use:

  * **Individual Fields**: Aggregate individual fields separately.
  * **All Item Data**: Aggregate all item data into a single list.

### Individual Fields#

  * **Input Field Name** : Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
  * **Rename Field** : This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
    * **Output Field Name** : This field is displayed when you turn on **Rename Field**. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.

Refer to Node options for more configuration options.

### All Item Data#

  * **Put Output in Field** : Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
  * **Include** : Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
    * **All fields** : The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
    * **Specified Fields** : If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
    * **All Fields Except** : If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.

Refer to Node options for more configuration options.

## Node options#

You can further configure this node using these **Options** :

  * **Disable Dot Notation** : The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
  * **Merge Lists** : The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
  * **Include Binaries** : The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
  * **Keep Missing And Null Values** : The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.

# hosting/installation/server-setups/google-cloud/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/server-setups/google-cloud.md "Edit this page")

# Hosting n8n on Google Cloud#

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud (GCP). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites#

  * The [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
  * The [gke-gcloud-auth-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) (install the gcloud CLI first)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Hosting options#

Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) instead to undertake all the steps.

## Create project#

GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.

## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API#

GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for "Kubernetes" in the top search bar and select "Kubernetes Engine" from the results.

Select **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.

## Create a cluster#

From the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview), select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the "Standard" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an "Autopilot" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.

## Set Kubectl context#

The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting **CONNECT**. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.

## Clone configuration repository#

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/gcp) locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.

Clone the repository with the following command:

    1

|

    git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b gcp

---|---

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

    1

|

    cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting

---|---

## Configure Postgres#

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Create a volume for persistent storage#

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke) for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    …
    allowedTopologies:
      - matchLabelExpressions:
          - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
            values:
              - us-central1-b
              - us-central1-c

---|---

### Postgres environment variables#

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n#

### Create a volume for file storage#

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

  * Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
  * If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    …
    volumes:
      - name: n8n-claim0
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: n8n-claim0
    …

---|---

### Pod resources#

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml` files:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    …
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "250Mi"
      limits:
        memory: "500Mi"
    …

---|---

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

  * **Start** : 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
  * **Pro (10k executions)** : 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
  * **Pro (50k executions)** : 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables#

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments#

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

  * Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
  * Define the container image to use
  * Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
  * The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
  * Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services#

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster#

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl apply -f .

---|---

Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

---|---

## Set up DNS#

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & Ingress** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **Endpoints** column.

GKE and IP addresses

[Read this GKE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#configuring_your_domain_name_records) for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.

## Delete resources#

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl delete -f .

---|---

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# Workflow Retriever node#

Use the Workflow Retriever node to retrieve data from an n8n workflow for use in a Retrieval QA Chain or another Retriever node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Workflow Retriever node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

### Source#

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

  * **Database** and enter a workflow ID.
  * **Parameter** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](../../../../../workflows/export-import/).

### Workflow values#

Set values to pass to the workflow you're calling.

These values appear in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you call. You can access these values in expressions in the workflow. For example, if you have:

  * **Workflow Values** with a **Name** of `myCustomValue`
  * A workflow with an Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node as its trigger

The expression to access the value of `myCustomValue` is `{{ $('Execute Sub-workflow Trigger').item.json.myCustomValue }}`.

# user-management/account-types/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/account-types.md "Edit this page")

# Account types#

There are three account types: owner, admin, and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.

Feature availability

To use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.

Account types and role types

Account types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](../rbac/).

Every account has one type. The account can have different [role types](../rbac/role-types/) for different [projects](../rbac/projects/).

Create a member-level account for the owner

n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

## Usage#

How to use the Code node.

### Choose a mode#

There are two modes:

  * **Run Once for All Items** : this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
  * **Run Once for Each Item** : choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

## JavaScript#

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features#

The Code node supports:

  * Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
  * Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries#

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

  * [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
  * [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables#

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts#

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python#

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables#

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts#

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the [list of keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests#

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

  * [Read/Write File From Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
  * [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Coding in n8n#

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

### Key concepts#

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

  * [Data structure](../../../../data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
  * [Item linking](../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables#

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

  * Accessing specific item data
  * Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
  * Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node#

Feature availability

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

  1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
  2. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
  3. Write your query.
  4. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## Common issues#

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime.md "Edit this page")

# Date & Time#

The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.

Timezone settings

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

  1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information.
  2. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

Date and time in other nodes

You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    timeDifference
    years : 1
    months : 3
    days : 13

---|---

If you turn on the **Output as ISO String** option, the node formats the output as a single ISO duration string, for example: `P1Y3M13D`.

ISO duration format displays a format as `P<n>Y<n>M<n>DT<n>H<n>M<n>S`. `<n>` is the number for the unit after it.

  * P = period (duration). It begins all ISO duration strings.
  * Y = years
  * M = months
  * W = weeks
  * D = days
  * T = delineator between dates and times, used to avoid confusion between months and minutes
  * H = hours
  * M = minutes
  * S = seconds

Milliseconds don't get their own unit, but instead are decimal seconds. For example, 2.1 milliseconds is `0.0021S`.

# Switch#

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](../n8n-nodes-base.if/) node, but supports multiple output routes.

## Node parameters#

Select the **Mode** the node should use:

  * **Rules** : Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.
  * **Expression** : Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.

Node configuration depends on the **Mode** you select.

### Rules#

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

  * Create **Routing Rules** to define comparison conditions.
    * Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
    * The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to Available data type comparisons for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
  * **Rename Output** : Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.

Select **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.

#### Rule options#

You can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options** :

  * **Fallback Output** : Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.
    * **None** : Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.
    * **Extra Output** : Send items to an extra, separate output.
    * **Output 0** : Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.
  * **Ignore Case** : Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).
  * **Less Strict Type Validation** : Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Send data to all matching outputs** : Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).

### Expression#

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

  * **Number of Outputs** : Set how many outputs the node should have.
  * **Output Index** : Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/test/troubleshooting-node-development.md "Edit this page")

# Troubleshooting#

## Credentials#

### Error message: 'Credentials of type "*" aren't known'#

Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

![Troubleshooting credentials](../../../../_images/integrations/creating-nodes/troubleshooting-credentials-1.png)

## Editor UI#

### Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'#

  * Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to `packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
  * Check that the names used in the `displayOptions` property are names used by UI elements in the node.

### Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI#

  * Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
  * Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
  * When the `icon` property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (`.png` or `.svg`) and that it prefixes it with `file:`. For example, `file:friendGrid.png` or `file:friendGrid.svg`.

### Node icon doesn't fit#

  * If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
  * If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu#

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.

### Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing#

Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (`ctrl` \+ `c`) and run it again. You may also need to re-run `npm link`.

### Linter incorrectly warning about file name case#

The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a [known Windows issue](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-renaming-when-changing-case-doesnt-work/aa15ff7c-dd2d-4ed3-bcce-799ca90d4e58) with changing case when renaming files.

# source-control-environments/create-environments/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/create-environments.md "Edit this page")

# Tutorial: Create environments with source control#

Feature availability

  * Available on Enterprise.
  * You must be an n8n instance owner or instance admin to enable and configure source control.
  * Instance owners and instance admins can push changes to and pull changes from the connected repository.
  * Project admins can push changes to the connected repository. They can't pull changes from the repository.

This tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:

  * [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.
  * [Git and n8n](../understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.

## Choose your source control pattern#

Before setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

### Multiple instances, multiple branches#

![Diagram](../../_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)

The advantages of this pattern are:

  * An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
  * It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

### Multiple instances, one branch#

![Diagram](../../_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

  * If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](./#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
  * Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

## Set up your repository#

Once you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.

Multi-branchSingle-branch

  1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
     * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
     * Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.
  2. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for guidance.

[Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

  * Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
  * Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.

## Connect your n8n instances to your repository#

Create two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.

### Configure Git in n8n#

  1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
  2. In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.
  3. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.
  4. Copy the SSH key.

### Set up a deploy key#

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys) for guidance.

### Connect n8n and configure your instance#

Multi-branchSingle-branch

  1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
  2. Under **Instance settings** , choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.
  3. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.
  4. Select **Save settings**.

  1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**.
  2. Under **Instance settings** , select the main branch.
  3. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.
  4. Select **Save settings**.

## Push work from development#

In your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.

To push work to Git:

  1. Select **Push** ![Push icon](../../_images/source-control-environments/push-icon.png) in the main menu.

View screenshot

![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is open

  2. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.

  3. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.
  4. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## Pull work to production#

Your work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.

Multi-branchSingle-branch

  1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.
  2. Merge the pull request.
  3. In your production instance, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.

In your production instance, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.

View screenshot

![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](../../_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png) Pull and push buttons when menu is open

### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls#

If you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and the [n8n API](../../api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.

A GitHub Action example:

     3
     4
     5
     6

      # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch
      push:

            run: >
              curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header
              'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Azure OpenAI node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/azureopenai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node options#

  * **Model (Deployment) Name** : Select the model (deployment) to use for generating embeddings.
  * **Batch Size** : Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.
  * **Strip New Lines** : Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.
  * **Timeout** : Enter the maximum amount of time a request can take in seconds. Set to `-1` for no timeout.

# user-management/two-factor-auth/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/two-factor-auth.md "Edit this page")

# Two-factor authentication (2FA)#

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.

## Enable 2FA#

You need an authenticator app on your phone.

To enable 2FA in n8n:

  1. Go to you **Settings** > **Personal**.
  2. Select **Enable 2FA**. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
  3. Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
  4. Enter the code from your app in **Code from authenticator app**.
  5. Select **Continue**. n8n displays recovery codes.
  6. Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.

## Disable 2FA for your instance#

Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting `N8N_MFA_ENABLED` to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to [Configuration methods](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.

# code/cookbook/code-node/console-log/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/code-node/console-log.md "Edit this page")

# Output to the browser console with `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node#

You can use `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

For help opening your browser console, refer to [this guide by Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/).

## console.log (JavaScript)#

For technical information on `console.log()`, refer to the [MDN developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log).

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

    1
    2

|

    let a = "apple";
    console.log(a);

---|---

## print (Python)#

For technical information on `print()`, refer to the [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-print/).

For example, set your Code node **Language** to **Python** , copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:

    1
    2

|

    a = "apple"
    print(a)

---|---

### Handling an output of `[object Object]`#

If the console displays `[object Object]` when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.

To check the data type:

    1

|

    print(type(myData))

---|---

#### JsProxy#

If `type()` outputs `<class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>`, you need to convert the JsProxy to a native Python object using `to_py()`. This occurs when working with data in the n8n node data structure, such as node inputs and outputs. For example, if you want to print the data from a previous node in the workflow:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    previousNodeData = _("<node-name>").all();
    for item in previousNodeData:
    	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
    	# You need to convert it to a Dict
    	itemDict = item.json.to_py()

# Elasticsearch credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Elasticsearch](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.elasticsearch/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Basic auth

## Related resources#

Refer to [Elasticsearch's documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html) for more information about the service.

## Using basic auth#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) account with a [deployment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-create-deployment.html) and:

  * A **Username**
  * A **Password**
  * Your Elasticsearch application's **Base URL** (also known as the Elasticsearch application endpoint)

To set up the credential:

  1. Enter your Elasticsearch **Username**.
  2. Enter your Elasticsearch **Password**.
  3. In Elasticsearch, go to **Deployments**.
  4. Select your deployment.
  5. Select **Manage this deployment**.
  6. In the **Applications** section, copy the endpoint of the **Elasticsearch** application.
  7. Enter this in n8n as the **Base URL**.
  8. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Custom endpoint aliases

If you add a [custom endpoint alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regional-deployment-aliases.html) to a deployment, update your n8n credential **Base URL** with the new endpoint.

# code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/code-node/get-binary-data-buffer.md "Edit this page")

# Get the binary data buffer#

The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:

  * Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
  * Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
  * Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.

Not available in Python

`getBinaryDataBuffer()` isn't supported when using Python.

You can access the buffer using n8n's `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    /*
    * itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data.
    * binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property.
    * The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'.
    */
    let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(itemIndex, binaryPropertyName);

---|---

For example:

    1
    2

|

    let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(0, 'data');
    // Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item

---|---

You should always use the `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like `items[0].binary.data.data`.

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines.md "Edit this page")

# UX guidelines for community nodes#

Your node's UI must conform to these guidelines to be a [verified community node](../../../deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n) candidate.

## Credentials#

API key and sensitive credentials should always be password fields.

### OAuth#

Always include the OAuth credential if available.

## Node structure#

### Operations to include#

Try to include **CRUD** operations for each resource type.

Try to include common operations in nodes for each resource. n8n uses some CRUD operations to keep the experience consistent and allow users to perform basic operations on the resource. The suggested operations are:

  * **Create**
  * **Create or Update (Upsert)**
  * **Delete**
  * **Get**
  * **Get Many:** also used when some filtering or search is available
  * **Update**

Notes:

  1. These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the **name of the entity** in the operations name.
  2. The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.

### Resource Locator#

  * Use a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.
  * The default option for the Resource Locator Component should be `From list` (if available).

### Consistency with other nodes#

  * Maintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.
  * Check similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.

### Sorting options#

  * You can enhance certain "Get Many" operations by providing users with sorting options.
  * Add sorting in a dedicated collection (below the "Options" collection). Follow the example of [Airtable Record:Search](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/92e2a8e61a4189025e5d4bac8be81576b624fe85/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable/v2/actions/record/search.operation.ts#L85-L135).

## Node functionality#

### Deleting operations output#

When deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: `{"deleted": true}`. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.

### Simplifying output fields#

#### Normal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter#

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the "Simplify" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.

  * One of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.
  * Select the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.
  * In the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields
  * Display Name: `Simplify`
  * Description: `Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data`

#### AI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter#

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.

In AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.

Options:

  * **Simplified:** Works the same as the "Simplify" parameter described above.
  * **Raw:** Returns all the available fields.
  * **Selected fields:** Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.

## Copy#

### Text Case#

Use **Title Case** for the node `name`, `parameters display names` (labels), `dropdown titles`. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.

Use **Sentence case** for node `action` names, node `descriptions`, `parameters descriptions` (tooltips), `hints`, `dropdown descriptions`.

### Terminology#

  * **Use the third-party service terminology:** Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').
  * **Use the terminology used in the UI:** Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you "archive" cards, but in the API they show up as "closed". In this case, you might want to use "archive").
  * **No tech jargon:** Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use "field" instead of "key".
  * **Consistent naming:** Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix "directory" and "folder".

### Placeholders#

It's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with "e.g." and use **camel case** for the demo content in fields.

Placeholder examples to copy:

  * image: `e.g. https://example.com/image.png`
  * video: `e.g. https://example.com/video.mp4`
  * search term: `e.g. automation`
  * email: `e.g. nathan@example.com`
  * Twitter user (or similar): `e.g. n8n`
  * Name and last name: `e.g. Nathan Smith`
  * First name: `e.g. Nathan`
  * Last name: `e.g. Smith`

### Operations name, action, and description#

  * **Name:** This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, "Delete").
  * **Action:** This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, "Delete record").
  * **Description:** This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, "Retrieve a list of users").
  * If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, "Delete Row").

As a general rule, is important to understand what the **object** of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, `Sheet:Delete` to delete a Sheet).

In other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, `Table:Delete rows`, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).

#### Naming `name`#

This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.

  * Parameter: `name`
  * Case: Title Case

Naming guidelines:

  * **Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above):** The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).
    * For example: `Sheet:Delete` → No need to repeat `Sheet` in `Delete`, because n8n displays `Sheet` in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.
  * **Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above:** In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.
    * For example: `Delete Records` → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.
  * **Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource:** Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.
    * For example: `Table:Get Columns` → Specify `Columns` because the resource is `Table`, while the object of the operation is `Columns`.

#### Naming `action`#

This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. * Parameter: `action` * Case: Sentence case

Naming guidelines:

  * **Omit articles:** To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).
    * **correct** : `Update row in sheet`
    * **incorrect** : `Update a row in a sheet`
  * **Repeat the resource:** In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.
  * **Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource:** Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.
    * For example: `Append Rows` → You have to specify `Rows` because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (`Sheet`) since you aren't appending to the resource.

#### Naming `description`#

This is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.

  * Parameter: `description`
  * Case: Sentence case

Naming guidelines:

  * If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation `name`
  * Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.

#### Vocabulary#

n8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).

The general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:

  * **Clear**
    * Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).
    * Description: `Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>`
  * **Create**
    * Create a new instance of the resource.
    * Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE>`
  * **Create or Update**
    * Create or update an existing instance of the resource.
    * Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)`
  * **Delete**
    * You can use "Delete" in two different ways:
      1. Delete a resource:
         * Description: `Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently` (use "permanently" only if that's the case)
      2. Delete something **inside** of the resource (for example, a row):
         * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation** : for example, `Delete Rows` or `Delete Records`.
         * Description: `Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently`
  * **Get**
    * You can use "Get" in two different ways:
      1. Get a resource:
         * Description: `Retrieve a <RESOURCE>`
      2. Get an item **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
         * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation** : for example, `Get Row` or `Get Record`.
         * Description: `Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>`
  * **Get Many**
    * You can use "Get Many" in two different ways:
      1. Get a list of resources (without filtering):
         * Description: `Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s`
      2. Get a list of items **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
         * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation** : for example, `Get Many Rows` or `Get Many Records`.
         * You can omit `Many`: `Get Many Rows` can be `Get Rows`.
         * Description: `List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>`
  * **Insert** or **Append**
    * Add something inside of a resource.
    * Use `insert` for database nodes.
    * Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>`
  * **Insert or Update** or **Append or Update**
    * Add or update something inside of a resource.
    * Use `insert` for database nodes.
    * Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)`
  * **Update**
    * You can use "Update" in two different ways:
      1. Update a resource:
         * Description: `Update one or more <RESOURCE>s`
      2. Update something **inside** of a resource (for example, a row):
         * In this case, **always specify the object of the operation** : for example, `Update Rows` or `Update Records`.
         * Description: `Update <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) inside a <RESOURCE>`

### Referring to parameter and field name#

When you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, "Please fill the `'name'` parameter).

### Boolean description#

Start the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'

## Errors#

### General philosophy#

Errors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:

  * **What happened** : a description of the error and what went wrong.
  * **How to solve the problem** : or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.

### Error structure in the Output panel#

#### Error Message - What happened#

This message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.

  * If you have the `displayName` of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).
  * Item index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append `[Item X]` to the error message. For example, `The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2]`.
  * Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

#### Error Description - How to solve or get unstuck#

The description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.

Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

# Google Sheets node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Append an array#

To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format.

To do so, consider using:

  1. The [Split Out](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) node.
  2. The [AI Transform](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/) node. For example, try entering something like:

         1

|

         Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs.

---|---

  3. The [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

## Column names were updated after the node's setup#

You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.

To refresh the column names, re-select **Mapping Column Mode**. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.

Once the column names refresh, update the node parameters.

# Contextual Compression Retriever node#

The Contextual Compression Retriever node improves the answers returned from [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) document similarity searches by taking into account the context from the query.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## AI glossary#

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.
  * **vector store** : A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

# Data#

Data is the information that n8n nodes receive and process. For basic usage of n8n you don't need to understand data structures and manipulation. However, it becomes important if you want to:

  * Create your own node
  * Write custom [expressions](../glossary/#expression-n8n)
  * Use the Function or Function Item node

This section covers:

  * [Data structure](data-structure/)
  * [Data flow within nodes](data-flow-nodes/)
  * [Transforming data](transforming-data/)
  * [Process data using code](code/)
  * [Pinning](data-pinning/) and [editing](data-editing/) data during workflow development.
  * [Data mapping](data-mapping/) and [Item linking](data-mapping/data-item-linking/): how data items link to each other.

## Related resources#

### Data transformation nodes#

n8n provides a collection of nodes to transform data:

  * [Aggregate](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
  * [Limit](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
  * [Remove Duplicates](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
  * [Sort](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
  * [Split Out](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
  * [Summarize](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

# Postgres Trigger node#

Use the Postgres Trigger node to respond to events in [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and integrate Postgres with other applications. n8n has built-in support responding to insert, update, and delete events.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/postgres/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Postgres Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/postgres-trigger/) page.

## Events#

You can configure how the node listens for events.

  * Select **Listen and Create Trigger Rule** , then choose the events to listen for:
    * Insert
    * Update
    * Delete
  * Select **Listen to Channel** , then enter a channel name that the node should monitor.

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters.md "Edit this page")

# Standard parameters#

These are the standard parameters for the [node base file](../). They're the same for all node types.

## `displayName`#

_String_ | _Required_

This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.

## `name`#

_String_ | _Required_

The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

## `icon`#

_String_ or _Object_ | _Required_

Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file.

You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes. If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:

    1

|

    icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'

---|---

To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    icon: {
      light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg',
      dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg'
    }

---|---

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

## `group`#

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:

  * `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.
  * `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.
  * `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.
  * An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.

## `description`#

_String_ | _Required_

A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.

## `defaults`#

_Object_ | _Required_

Contains essential brand and name settings.

The object can include:

  * `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.
  * `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.

## `forceInputNodeExecution`#

_Boolean_ | _Optional_

When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).

## `inputs`#

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.

## `outputs`#

_Array of strings_ | _Required_

Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.

## `requiredInputs`#

_Integer_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.

## `credentials`#

_Array of objects_ | _Required_

This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.

The object must include:

  * `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'` in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts) links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).
  * `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.

## `requestDefaults`#

_Object_ | _Required_

Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.

This object must include:

  * `baseURL`: The API base URL.

You can also add:

  * `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
  * `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.

## `properties`#

_Array of objects_ | _Required_

This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.

### Resource objects#

A resource object includes the following parameters:

  * `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.
  * `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.
  * `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../../ui-elements/) for more information.
  * `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`.

### Operations objects#

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

  * `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.
  * `name`: String. This should always be `option`.
  * `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](../../ui-elements/) for more information.
  * `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.
  * `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:
    * `name`. String.
    * `value`. String.
    * `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `"Card"` and an operation `"Get all"`, your action is `"Get all cards"`.
    * `description`: String.
    * `routing`: Object containing request details.

### Additional fields objects#

These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

The objects must include:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17

|

    displayName: 'Additional Fields',
    name: 'additionalFields',
    // The UI element type
    type: ''
    placeholder: 'Add Field',
    default: {},
    displayOptions: {
      // Set which resources and operations this field is available for
      show: {
        resource: [
          // Resource names
        ],
        operation: [
          // Operation names
        ]
      },
    }

# api/using-api-playground/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/api/using-api-playground.md "Edit this page")

# Using the API playground#

Feature availability

The API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.

The n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.

n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:

    1

|

    N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs

---|---

The API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.

Real data

If you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.

The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:

    1

|

    N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}

---|---

How to find `credentialTypeName`

To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9

|

    {
        ...,
        "credentials": {
            "googleDriveOAuth2Api": {
            "id": "9",
            "name": "Google Drive"
            }
        }
    }

If you've found your way here, it means you're serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.

These tasks can and should be automated! And you don't need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this–with no-code tools like n8n, automation is for everyone.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmailtrigger/poll-mode-options.md "Edit this page")

# Gmail Trigger node Poll Mode options#

Use the [Gmail Trigger node's](../) **Poll Time** parameter to set how often to trigger the poll. Your **Mode** selection will add or remove relevant fields.

## Poll mode options#

Refer to the sections below for details on using each **Mode**.

### Every Hour mode#

Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

### Every Day mode#

  * Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
  * Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

### Every Week mode#

  * Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
  * Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.
  * Select the **Weekday** to trigger the poll.

### Every Month mode#

  * Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
  * Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.
  * Enter the **Day of the Month** to trigger the poll, from `0` to `31`.

### Every X mode#

  * Enter the **Value** of measurement for how often to trigger the poll in either minutes or hours.
  * Select the **Unit** for the value. Supported units are **Minutes** and **Hours**.

### Custom mode#

Enter a custom **Cron Expression** to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:

  * Seconds: `0` \- `59`
  * Minutes: `0` \- `59`
  * Hours: `0` \- `23`
  * Day of Month: `1` \- `31`
  * Months: `0` \- `11` (Jan - Dec)
  * Day of Week: `0` \- `6` (Sun - Sat)

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Cron Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples#

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

    1

|

    30 8 4 * * *

---|---

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

    1

|

    8 4 * * *

---|---

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression#

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

* | * | * | * | * | *
---|---|---|---|---|---
second | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week

# Embeddings Ollama node#

Use the Embeddings Ollama node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Ollama node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/ollama/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the embedding. Choose from:
    * [all-minilm](https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm) (384 Dimensions)
    * [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) (768 Dimensions)

# source-control-environments/using/copy-work/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/using/copy-work.md "Edit this page")

# Copy work between environments#

The steps to send work from one n8n instance to another are different depending on whether you use a single Git branch or multiple branches.

## Single branch#

If you have a single Git branch the steps to copy work are:

  1. Push work from one instance to the Git branch.
  2. Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can automate pulls.

## Multiple branches#

If you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n.

A common pattern is:

  1. Do work in your developments instance.
  2. Push the work to the development branch in Git.
  3. Merge your development branch into your production branch. Refer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:
     * [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
     * [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
     * [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
  4. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can automate pulls.

## Automatically send changes to n8n#

You can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

|

    curl --request POST \
    	--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \
    	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
    	--data '{"force": true}'

---|---

This means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.

A GitHub Action example:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16

|

    name: CI
    on:
      # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch
      push:
        branches: [ "production" ]
      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
      workflow_dispatch:
    jobs:
      run-pull:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: PULL
    				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information
            run: >
              curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header
              'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'

# Build an AI chat agent with n8n#

Welcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes.

!["Screenshot of the completed workflow"](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro01.png)

Many people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both!

### What you will need#

  * **n8n** : For this tutorial we recommend using the [n8n cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/) service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the [installation pages](../../hosting/installation/docker/).
  * **Credentials for a chat model** : This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the [sub-nodes documentation](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) for more).

### What you will learn#

  * AI concepts in n8n
  * How to use the AI Agent node
  * Working with Chat input
  * Connecting with AI models
  * Customising input
  * Observing the conversation
  * Adding persistence

## AI concepts in n8n#

If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.

An [AI agent](../../glossary/#ai-agent) builds on [Large Language Models (LLMs)](../../glossary/#large-language-model-llm), which generate text based on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use [tools](../../glossary/#ai-tool), process their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.

In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections.

Feature | LLM | AI Agent
---|---|---
Core Capability | Text generation | Goal-oriented task completion
Decision-Making | None | Yes
Uses Tools/APIs | No | Yes
Workflow Complexity | Single-step | Multi-step
Scope | Generates language | Performs complex, real-world tasks
Example | LLM generating a paragraph | An agent scheduling an appointment

By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the _content_ of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent.

## 1\. Create a new workflow#

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

  * An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
  * The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the ![universal create resource icon](../../_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** to create a new workflow.

## 2\. Add a trigger node#

Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called ['trigger nodes'](../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n). For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node.

  1. Select **Add first step** or press `Tab` to open the node menu.

  2. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

  3. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.

  4. Close the node details view (Select **Back to canvas**) to return to the canvas.

More about the Chat Trigger node...

The trigger node generates output when there is an event causing it to trigger. In this case we want to be able to type in text to cause the workflow to run. In production, this trigger can be hooked up to a public chat interface as provided by n8n or embedded into another website. To start this simple workflow we will just use the built-in local chat interface to communicate, so no further setup is required.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_01.json)

## 3\. Add an AI Agent Node#

The AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows.

  1. Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search.

  2. Start typing "AI" and choose the **AI agent** node to add it.

  3. The editing view of the **AI agent** will now be displayed.

  4. There are some fields which can be changed. As we're using the **Chat Trigger** node, the default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_02.json)

## 4\. Configure the node#

AI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts.

  1. Add a chat model by clicking the plus ![Add node icon](../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) button underneath the **Chat Model** connection on the **AI Agent** node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).

  2. The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use **OpenAI Chat Model**.

  3. Selecting the **OpenAI Chat model** from the list will attach it to the **AI Agent** node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.

Which chat model?

As mentioned earlier, the LLM is the component which generates the text according to a prompt it is given. LLMs have to be created and trained, usually an intensive process. Different LLMS may have different capabilities or specialties, depending on the data they were trained with.

## 5\. Add credentials (if needed)#

In order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some [credentials](../../credentials/) (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.

![image showing the credentials dialog for OpenAI](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-credentials.png)

  1. To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear ![Screenshot showing create a new credential button](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-create-credential.png)

  2. This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.

  3. The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the **API key** section.

Keeping your credentials safe

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

## 6\. Test the node#

Now that the node is connected to the **Chat Trigger** and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow.

  1. Click on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right.

  2. Type in a message and press `Enter`. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message.

  3. The log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent. ![image showing a chat session in progress](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-chat.png)

Accessing the logs...

You can access the logs for the AI node even when you aren't using the chat interface. Open up the **AI Agent** node and click on the **Logs** tab in the right hand panel. ![screenshot showing the Logs tab in the AIAgent](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-logs.png)

## 7\. Changing the prompt#

The logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the **AI Agent** primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to "You are a helpful assistant". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.

  1. Open the **AI Agent** node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'

  2. The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like "You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets" for example.

  3. Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed. ![image showing changed text for chat, now it rhymes; if you can believe that](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-poet.png)

## 8\. Adding persistence#

The chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation.

  1. Use the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example "Hi there, my name is Nick".

  2. Wait for the response, then type the message "What's my name?". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no [memory](../../glossary/#ai-memory). ![image showing a conversation illustrating the above](../../_images/advanced-ai/ai-intro-memory.png)

  3. In order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the **AI Agent** node. On the canvas click on the ![Add node icon](../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) on the bottom of the **AI Agent** node labeled "Memory".

  4. From the panel which appears, select "Simple Memory". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later.

  5. Repeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name.

## 9\. Saving the workflow#

Before we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost.

  1. Click on the "Save" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features.

## Congratulations!#

You have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an **AI Agent** and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.

# Google Drive Trigger node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## 401 unauthorized error#

The full text of the error looks like this:

    1

|

    401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}

---|---

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

To resolve:

  1. For [OAuth2](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Google Drive API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
  2. For [Service Account](../../../credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
     1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
     2. Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Handling more than one file change#

The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default).

If multiple changes to the **Watch For** criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item.

You can use an [if node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or a [switch node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

# integrations/builtin/credentials/mattermost/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/mattermost.md "Edit this page")

# Mattermost credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Mattermost](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API access token

## Related resources#

Refer to [Mattermost's API documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.com/) account and:

  * A personal **Access Token**
  * Your Mattermost **Base URL**.

To set it up:

  1. In Mattermost, go to **Profile > Security > Personal Access Tokens**.

No Personal Access Tokens option

If you don't see the Personal Access Tokens option, refer to the troubleshooting steps in Enable personal access tokens below.

  2. Select **Create Token**.

  3. Enter a **Token description** , like `n8n integration`.
  4. Select **Save**.
  5. Copy the **Token ID** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
  6. Enter your Mattermost URL as the **Base URL**.
  7. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information.

## Enable personal access tokens#

Not seeing the **Personal Access Tokens** option has two possible causes:

  * Mattermost doesn't have the personal access tokens integration enabled.
  * You're trying to generate a personal access token as a non-admin user who doesn't have permission to generate personal access tokens.

To identify the root cause and resolve it:

  1. Log in to Mattermost as an admin.
  2. Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**.
  3. Confirm that **Enable personal access tokens** is set to **true**. If it's not, change.
  4. Go to **System Console > User Management > Users**.
  5. Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.
  6. Select the **Actions** dropdown for the user and select **Manage roles**.
  7. Check the box for **Allow this account to generate personal access tokens** and **Save**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information.

## Node parameters#

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

  * **Credential to connect with** : Select or create a [JWT credential](../../credentials/jwt/) to connect with.
  * **Token** : Enter the token to **Verify** or **Decode**.
  * If you select the **Sign** operation, you'll also have this parameter:
    * **Use JSON to Build Payload** : When turned on, the node uses JSON to build the claims. The selection here influences what appears in the Payload Claims section.

## Payload Claims#

The node only displays payload claims if you select the **Sign** operation. What you see depends on what you select for **Use JSON to Build Payload** :

  * If you select **Use JSON to Build Payload** , this section displays a JSON editor where you can construct the claims.
  * If you don't select **Use JSON to Build Payload** , this section prompts you to **Add Claim**.

You can add the following claims.

### Audience#

The **Audience** or `aud` claim identifies the intended recipients of the JWT.

Refer to ["aud" (Audience) Claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3) for more information.

### Expires In#

The **Expires In** or `exp` claim identifies the time after which the JWT expires and must not be accepted for processing.

Refer to ["exp" (Expiration Time) Claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) for more information.

### Issuer#

The **Issuer** or `iss` claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT.

Refer to ["iss" (Issuer) Claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1) for more information.

### JWT ID#

# code/variables/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/variables.md "Edit this page")

# Custom variables#

Feature availability

  * Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro Cloud plans.
  * You need access to the n8n instance owner account to create and edit variables. All users can use existing variables.

Available in version 0.225.0 and above.

Custom variables are read-only variables that you can use to store and reuse values in n8n workflows.

Variables are shared

When you create a variable, it's available to everyone on your n8n instance.

## Create variables#

To create a new variable:

  1. On the **Variables** page, select **Add Variable**.
  2. Enter a **Key** and **Value**. The maximum key length is 50 characters, and the maximum value length is 220 characters. n8n limits the characters you can use in the key and value to lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
  3. Select **Save**. The variable is now available for use in all workflows in the n8n instance.

## Edit and delete variables#

To edit or delete a variable:

  1. On the **Variables** page, hover over the variable you want to change.
  2. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.

## Use variables in workflows#

You can access variables in the Code node and in [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n):

    1
    2

|

    // Access a variable
    $vars.<variable-name>

---|---

All variables are strings.

During workflow execution, n8n replaces the variables with the variable value. If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as `undefined`. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.

Variables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use [Workflow static data](../cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/).

# integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md "Edit this page")

# Schedule Trigger node#

Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

You must activate the workflow

If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.

Timezone settings

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

  1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information.
  2. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

## Node parameters#

Add **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.

Use the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:

  * Seconds trigger interval
  * Minutes trigger interval
  * Hours trigger interval
  * Days trigger interval
  * Weeks trigger interval
  * Months trigger interval
  * Custom (Cron) interval

You can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.

Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to Templates and examples for further examples.

### Seconds trigger interval#

  * **Seconds Between Triggers** : Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.

### Minutes trigger interval#

  * **Minutes Between Triggers** : Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.

### Hours trigger interval#

  * **Hours Between Triggers** : Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
  * **Trigger at Minute** : Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute** , the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.

### Days trigger interval#

  * **Days Between Triggers** : Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
  * **Trigger at Hour** : Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
  * **Trigger at Minute** : Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers** , **9am** for **Trigger at Hour** , and `15` **Trigger at Minute** , the node will run every two days at 9:15am.

### Weeks trigger interval#

  * **Weeks Between Triggers** : Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
  * **Trigger on Weekdays** : Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
  * **Trigger at Hour** : Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
  * **Trigger at Minute** : Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers** , **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays** , **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour** , and `30` **Trigger at Minute** , the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.

### Months trigger interval#

  * **Months Between Triggers** : Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
  * **Trigger at Day of Month** : Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.
  * **Trigger at Hour** : Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
  * **Trigger at Minute** : Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers** , `28` **Trigger at Day of Month** , **9am** for **Trigger at Hour** , and `0` **Trigger at Minute** , the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.

### Custom (Cron) interval#

Enter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples#

Type | Cron Expression | Description
---|---|---
Every X Seconds | `*/10 * * * * *` | Every 10 seconds.
Every X Minutes | `*/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes.
Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Every hour on the hour.
Daily | `0 6 * * *` | At 6:00 AM every day.
Weekly | `0 12 * * 1` | At noon every Monday.
Monthly | `0 0 1 * *` | At midnight on the 1st of every month.
Every X Days | `0 0 */3 * *` | At midnight every 3rd day.
Only Weekdays | `0 9 * * 1-5` | At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday.
Custom Hourly Range | `0 9-17 * * *` | Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day.
Quarterly | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October.

Using variables in the Cron expression

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to **Inactive** and then back to **Active** again

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression#

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

(*) | * | * | * | * | *
---|---|---|---|---|---
(second) | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week(Sun-Sat)

# Error Trigger node#

You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.

## Usage#

  1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
  2. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
  3. Select **Save**.
  4. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
     1. Select **Options** ![Options menu icon](../../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Settings**.
     2. In **Error workflow** , select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
     3. Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

Note the following:

  * If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
  * If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
  * You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

## Templates and examples#

[Browse Error Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/error-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Related resources#

You can use the [Stop And Error](../n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to send custom messages to the Error Trigger.

Read more about [Error workflows](../../../../flow-logic/error-handling/) in n8n workflows.

## Error data#

All information is always present, except:

  * `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
  * `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
  * `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

# Facebook Trigger Certificate Transparency object#

Use this object to receive updates about newly issued certificates for any domains that you have subscribed for certificate alerts or phishing alerts. Refer to [Facebook Trigger](../) for more information on the trigger itself.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

## Trigger configuration#

To configure the trigger with this Object:

  1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
  2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
  3. Select **Certificate Transparency** as the **Object**.
  4. **Field Names or IDs** : By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
     * **Certificate** : Notifies you when someone issues a new certificate for your subscribed domains. You'll need to subscribe your domain for certificate alerts.
     * **Phishing** : Notifies you when someone issues a new certificate that may be phishing one of your legitimate subscribed domains.
  5. In **Options** , turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.

For these alerts, you'll need to subscribe your domain to the relevant alerts:

  * Refer to [Certificate Alerts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/certificate-transparency-api#certificate-alerts-subscribing) for Certificate Alerts subscriptions.
  * Refer to [Phishing Alerts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/certificate-transparency-api#phishing-alerts-subscribing) for Phishing Alerts subscriptions.

# Simple Memory node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Simple Memory node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Single memory instance#

If you add more than one Simple Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Managing the Session ID#

In most cases, the `sessionId` is automatically retrieved from the **On Chat Message** trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase `No sessionId`.

If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a `sessionId`.

If you're not using the **On Chat Message** trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.

For testing purposes, you can use a static key like `my_test_session`. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.

# hosting/installation/server-setups/azure/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/server-setups/azure.md "Edit this page")

# Hosting n8n on Azure#

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Azure. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites#

You need [The Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Hosting options#

Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.

## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service#

From [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select **Kubernetes services**.

## Create a cluster#

From the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.

## Set Kubectl context#

The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.

## Clone configuration repository#

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/azure). The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

    1

|

    git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure

---|---

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

    1

|

    cd azure

---|---

## Configure Postgres#

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage#

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

Specialized storage classes

If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, [read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes).

### Postgres environment variables#

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

## Configure n8n#

### Create a volume for file storage#

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

  * Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
  * If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6

|

    …
    volumes:
      - name: n8n-claim0
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: n8n-claim0
    …

---|---

### Pod resources#

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7

|

    …
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "250Mi"
      limits:
        memory: "500Mi"
    …

---|---

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

  * **Start** : 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
  * **Pro (10k executions)** : 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
  * **Pro (50k executions)** : 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables#

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## Deployments#

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

  * Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
  * Define the container image to use
  * Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
  * The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
  * Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

## Services#

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster#

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl apply -f .

---|---

Namespace error

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml

---|---

## Set up DNS#

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, "5678" to the URL.

Static IP addresses with AKS

[Read this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip) for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS.

## Delete resources#

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

    1

|

    kubectl delete -f .

---|---

## Next steps#

  * Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
  * Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

# All executions#

To view **all executions** from an n8n instance, navigate to the **Overview** page and then click into the Executions tab. This will show you all executions from the workflows you have access to.

If your n8n instance supports **projects** , you'll also be able to view the executions tab within projects you have access to. This will show you executions only from the workflows within the specified project.

Deleted workflows

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

## Filter executions#

You can filter the executions list:

  1. Select the **Executions** tab either from within the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list.
  2. Select **Filters**.
  3. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
     * **Workflows** : choose all workflows, or a specific workflow name.
     * **Status** : choose from **Failed** , **Running** , **Success** , or **Waiting**.
     * **Execution start** : see executions that started in the given time.
     * **Saved custom data** : this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

Feature availability

Custom executions data is available on:

  * Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
  * Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

# Manual Trigger node#

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Test Workflow** and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) firing on a set schedule.

The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.

Use this trigger:

  * To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
  * When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.

## Common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow#

This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.

Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.

# HTTP Request node#

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) to use as a [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).

When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.

There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the node parameters or import a curl command.

Credentials

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Node parameters#

### Method#

Select the method to use for the request:

  * DELETE
  * GET
  * HEAD
  * OPTIONS
  * PATCH
  * POST
  * PUT

### URL#

Enter the endpoint you want to use.

### Authentication#

n8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

#### Predefined credentials#

Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

#### Generic credentials#

Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method.

You can select one of the following methods:

  * Basic auth
  * Custom auth
  * Digest auth
  * Header auth
  * OAuth1 API
  * OAuth2 API
  * Query auth

Refer to [HTTP request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Send Query Parameters#

Query parameters act as filters on HTTP requests. If the API you're interacting with supports them and the request you're making needs a filter, turn this option on.

**Specify your query parameters** using one of the available options:

  * **Using Fields Below** : Enter **Name** /**Value** pairs of **Query Parameters**. To enter more query parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the name of the field you're filtering on, and the value is the filter value.
  * **Using JSON** : Enter **JSON** to define your query parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Headers#

Use this parameter to send headers with your request. Headers contain metadata or context about your request.

**Specify Headers** using one of the available options:

  * **Using Fields Below** : Enter **Name** /**Value** pairs of **Header Parameters**. To enter more header parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the header you wish to set, and the value is the value you want to pass for that header.
  * **Using JSON** : Enter **JSON** to define your header parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Send Body#

If you need to send a body with your API request, turn this option on.

Then select the **Body Content Type** that best matches the format for the body content you wish to send.

#### Form URLencoded#

Use this option to send your body as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Specify Body** using one of the available options:

  * **Using Fields Below** : Enter **Name** /**Value** pairs of **Body Parameters**. To enter more body parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name should be the form field name, and the value is what you wish to set that field to.
  * **Using Single Field** : Enter your name/value pairs in a single **Body** parameter with format `fieldname1=value1&fieldname2=value2`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### Form-Data#

Use this option to send your body as `multipart/form-data`.

Configure your **Body Parameters** by selecting the **Parameter Type** :

  * Choose **Form Data** to enter **Name** /**Value** pairs.
  * Choose **n8n Binary File** to pull the body from a file the node has access to.
    * **Name** : Enter the ID of the field to set.
    * **Input Data Field Name** : Enter the name of the incoming field containing the binary file data you want to process.

Select **Add Parameter** to enter more parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### JSON#

Use this option to send your body as JSON.

**Specify Body** using one of the available options:

  * **Using Fields Below** : Enter **Name** /**Value** pairs of **Body Parameters**. To enter more body parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**.
  * **Using JSON** : Enter **JSON** to define your body.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

#### n8n Binary File#

Use this option to send the contents of a file stored in n8n as the body.

Enter the name of the incoming field that contains the file as the **Input Data Field Name**.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance on how to format the file.

#### Raw#

Use this option to send raw data in the body.

  * **Content Type** : Enter the `Content-Type` header to use for the raw body content. Refer to the IANA [Media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) documentation for a full list of MIME content types.
  * **Body** : Enter the raw body content to send.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

## Node options#

Select **Add Option** to view and select these options. Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.

### Array Format in Query Parameters#

Option availability

This option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.

Use this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:

  * **No Brackets** : Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.
  * **Brackets Only** : The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.
  * **Brackets with Indices** : The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.

### Batching#

Control how to batch large numbers of input items:

  * **Items per Batch** : Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
  * **Batch Interval** : Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.

### Ignore SSL Issues#

By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.

### Lowercase Headers#

Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).

### Redirects#

Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.

### Response#

Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:

  * **Include Response Headers and Status** : By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
  * **Never Error** : By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
  * **Response Format** : Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
    * **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
    * **File** : Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.
    * **JSON** : Select this option to format the response as JSON.
    * **Text** : Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.

### Pagination#

Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.

Inspect the API data first

Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.

Understand pagination

Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.

For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.

If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.

Configure the pagination settings:

  * **Pagination Mode** :
    * **Off** : Turn off pagination.
    * **Update a Parameter in Each Request** : Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
    * **Response Contains Next URL** : Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.

For example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](../../../../code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/).

n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:

Variable | Description
---|---
`$pageCount` | The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.
`$request` | The request object sent by the HTTP node.
`$response` | The response object from the HTTP call. Includes `$response.body`, `$response.headers`, and `$response.statusCode`. The contents of `body` and `headers` depend on the data sent by the API.

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

  * Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
  * Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
  * The structure of the data that the API returns.

### Proxy#

Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.

Enter the **Proxy** the request should use.

### Timeout#

Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.

Enter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.

## Tool-only options#

The following options are only available when attached to an [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) as a [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).

### Optimize Response#

Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.

When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:

#### JSON#

When expecting a **JSON** response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:

  * **Field Containing Data** : This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
  * **Include Fields** : This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
    * **All** : Include all fields in the response object.
    * **Selected** : Include only the fields specified below.
      * **Fields** : A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
    * **Exclude** : Include all fields _except_ the fields specified below.
      * **Fields** : A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.

#### HTML#

When expecting **HTML** , you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:

  * **Selector (CSS)** : A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the `body` element by default.
  * **Return Only Content** : Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
    * **Elements To Omit** : A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
  * **Truncate Response** : Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
    * **Max Response Characters** : The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

#### Text#

When expecting a generic **Text** response, you can optimize the results with the following options:

  * **Truncate Response** : Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
    * **Max Response Characters** : The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

## Import curl command#

[curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.

Import a curl command:

  1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.
  2. Paste your curl command into the text box.
  3. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

# LangChain Code node methods#

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the [LangChain Code node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/).

LangChain Code node only

These variables are for use in expressions in the LangChain Code node. You can't use them in other nodes.

Method | Description
---|---
`this.addInputData(inputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main input. Useful for mocking data.

  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore`
  * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](../../../data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n.

`this.addOutputData(outputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main output. Useful for mocking data.

  * `outputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore`
  * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](../../../data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n.

`this.getInputConnectionData(inputName, itemIndex, inputIndex?)` | Get data from a specified non-main input.

  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore`
  * `itemIndex` should always be `0` (this parameter will be used in upcoming functionality)
  * Use `inputIndex` if there is more than one node connected to the specified input.

`this.getInputData(inputIndex?, inputName?)` | Get data from the main input.
`this.getNode()` | Get the current node.
`this.getNodeOutputs()` | Get the outputs of the current node.
`this.getExecutionCancelSignal()` | Use this to stop the execution of a function when the workflow stops. In most cases n8n handles this, but you may need to use it if building your own chains or agents. It replaces the [Cancelling a running LLMChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain#cancelling-a-running-llmchain) code that you'd use if building a LangChain application normally.

# integrations/community-nodes/risks/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/community-nodes/risks.md "Edit this page")

# Risks when using community nodes#

Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

  * System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
  * Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
  * Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

n8n vets verified community nodes

In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](../installation/verified-install/). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.

## Report bad community nodes#

You can report bad community nodes to [security@n8n.io](mailto: security@n8n.io)

## Disable community nodes#

If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`. On n8n cloud, visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) and disable community nodes from there. See [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) for more information.

# manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/manage-cloud/cloud-data-management.md "Edit this page")

# Cloud data management#

There are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:

  * Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.
  * Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data

## Memory limits on each Cloud plan#

Current plans:

  * Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
  * Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
  * Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
  * Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
  * Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

Legacy plans:

  * Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
  * Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

n8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.

## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow#

The way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.

  * Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
  * Avoid using the Code node where possible.
  * Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
  * Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

Note that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.

Interactions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.

## How to manage execution data on Cloud#

Execution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.

Binary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.

If a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.

There are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:

In the admin dashboard:

  1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.
  2. Select **Manage**.
  3. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.

In your workflow settings:

  1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu.
  2. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
  3. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.

## Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention#

### Automatic data pruning#

n8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:

  * Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;
  * Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;
  * Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.

### Manual data pruning#

Heavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.

  1. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.
  2. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.

Due to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up.

# Postgres Chat Memory node#

Use the Postgres Chat Memory node to use Postgres as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server for storing chat history.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Postgres Chat Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/postgres/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Session Key** : Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
  * **Table Name** : Enter the name of the table to store the chat history in. The system will create the table if doesn't exist.
  * **Context Window Length** : Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

## Related resources#

Refer to [LangChain's Postgres Chat Message History documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/postgres) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Single memory instance#

If you add more than one Postgres Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## AI glossary#

  * **completion** : Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.
  * **hallucinations** : Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.
  * **vector database** : A vector database stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/index.md "Edit this page")

# Data item linking#

An item is a single piece of data. Nodes receive one or more items, operate on them, and output new items. Each item links back to previous items.

You need to understand this behavior if you're:

  * Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.
  * Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow.
  * Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.

This section provides:

  * A conceptual overview of [Item linking concepts](item-linking-concepts/).
  * Information on [Item linking for node creators](item-linking-node-building/).
  * Support for end users who need to [Work with the data path](item-linking-code-node/) to retrieve item data from previous nodes, and link items when using the Code node.
  * Guidance on troubleshooting [Errors](item-linking-errors/).

# flow-logic/subworkflows/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/subworkflows.md "Edit this page")

# Sub-workflows#

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](../../hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.

Sub-wokflow executions don't count towards your plan's monthly execution or active workflow limits.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow#

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow#

  1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

  2. **Optional** : configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

     1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
     2. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.
  3. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).
  4. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
     * **Define using fields below** : Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
     * **Define using JSON example** : Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
     * **Accept all data** : Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.
  5. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.
  6. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

  1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
  2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
  3. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
  4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
  5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../workflows/executions/debug/).
  6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow#

  1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.
  2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.
  3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

  4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

  5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows#

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B** :

  1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
  2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

## Sub-workflow conversion#

See [sub-workflow conversion](../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) for how to divide your existing workflows into sub-workflows.

# Default Data Loader node#

Use the Default Data Loader node to load binary data files or JSON data for [vector stores](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) or summarization.

On this page, you'll find a list of parameters the Default Data Loader node supports, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Text Splitting** : Choose from:
    * **Simple** : Uses the [Recursive Character Text Splitter](../n8n-nodes-langchain.textsplitterrecursivecharactertextsplitter/) with a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200.
    * **Custom** : Allows you to connect a text splitter of your choice.
  * **Type of Data** : Select **Binary** or **JSON**.
  * **Mode** : Choose from:
    * **Load All Input Data** : Use all the node's input data.
    * **Load Specific Data** : Use [expressions](../../../../../code/expressions/) to define the data you want to load. You can add text as well as expressions. This means you can create a custom document from a mix of text and expressions.
  * **Data Format** : Displays when you set **Type of Data** to **Binary**. Select the file MIME type for your binary data. Set to **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** if you want n8n to set the data format for you. If you set a specific data format and the incoming file MIME type doesn't match it, the node errors. If you use **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** , the node falls back to text format if it can't match the file MIME type to a supported data format.

## Node options#

  * **Metadata** : Set the metadata that should accompany the document in the vector store. This is what you match to using the **Metadata Filter** option when retrieving data using the vector store nodes.

# Ollama Model node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters#

The Ollama Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance#

The Ollama Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.

To use the Ollama Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker#

The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker#

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

    1

|

    docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama

---|---

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker#

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux** , use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

    1

|

    docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

---|---

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers#

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container#

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434#

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies#

Ollama doesn't support custom HTTP agents in its configuration. This makes it difficult to use Ollama behind custom HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Depending on your proxy configuration, it might not work at all, despite setting the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

Refer to [Ollama's FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-use-ollama-behind-a-proxy) for more information.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines.md "Edit this page")

# Community node verification guidelines#

Do you want n8n to verify your node?

Consider following these guidelines while building your node if you want to submit it for verification by n8n. Any user with verified community nodes enabled can discover and install verified nodes from n8n's nodes panel.

## Package source verification#

  * Verify that your npm package repository URL matches the expected GitHub (or other platform) repository.
  * Confirm that the package author / maintainer matches between npm and the repository.
  * Confirm that the git link in npm works and that the repository is public.
  * Make sure your package has proper documentation (README, usage examples, etc.).
  * Make sure your package license is MIT.

## No external dependencies#

  * Ensure that your package does **not** include any external dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Proper documentation#

  * Provide clear documentation, whether it’s a **README** on GitHub or links to relevant **API documentation**.
  * Include usage instructions, example workflows, and any necessary authentication details.

## No access to environment variables or file system#

  * The code **must not** interact with environment variables or attempt to read/write files.
  * Pass all necessary data through node parameters.

## Follow n8n best practices#

  * Maintain a clear and consistent coding style.
  * Use **TypeScript** and follow n8n's [**node development guidelines**](../../../overview/).
  * Ensure proper error handling and validation.
  * Make sure the linter passes (in other words, make sure running `npx @n8n/scan-community-package n8n-nodes-PACKAGE` passes).

## Related resources#

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).

## Use query parameters#

When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12

|

    [
        {
            "email": "alex@example.com",
            "name": "Alex",
            "age": 21
        },
        {
            "email": "jamie@example.com",
            "name": "Jamie",
            "age": 33
        }
    ]

---|---

You can write a query like:

    1

|

    SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;

---|---

Then in **Query Parameters** , provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

    1
    2

|

    // users is an example table name
    {{ [ 'users', $json.email ] }}

---|---

# Calculator node#

The Calculator node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to run mathematical calculations.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

# Custom Code Tool node#

Use the Custom Code Tool node to write code that an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) can run.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Custom Code Tool node and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

### Description#

Give your custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

### Language#

You can use JavaScript or Python.

### JavaScript / Python box#

Write the code here.

You can access the tool input using `query`. For example, to take the input string and lowercase it:

    1
    2

|

    let myString = query;
    return myString.toLowerCase();

# Automating a (Real-world) Use Case#

Meet Nathan 🙋. Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.

Some things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert** , you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.

## Understanding the scenario#

**You 👩‍🔧:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?

**Nathan 🙋:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.

I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.

This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?

**Nathan 🙋:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging.md "Edit this page")

# Logging in n8n#

Logging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging library.

Log streaming

n8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes [Log streaming](../../../log-streaming/), in addition to the logging options described in this document.

## Setup#

To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the [configuration file](../../configuration/environment-variables/))

Setting in the configuration file | Using environment variables | Description
---|---|---
n8n.log.level | N8N_LOG_LEVEL | The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is `info`. You can learn more about these options here.
n8n.log.output | N8N_LOG_OUTPUT | Where to output logs. The available options are `console` and `file`. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (`,`). `console` is used by default.
n8n.log.file.location | N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION | The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default, `<n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log` is used.
n8n.log.file.maxsize | N8N_LOG_FILE_SIZE_MAX | The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB.
n8n.log.file.maxcount | N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX | The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers.

    # Set the logging level to 'debug'
    export N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug

    # Set log output to both console and a log file
    export N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file

    # Set a save location for the log file
    export N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log

    # Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file
    export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXSIZE=50

    # Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept
    export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXCOUNT=60

---|---

### Log levels#

n8n uses standard log levels to report:

  * `silent`: outputs nothing at all
  * `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else
  * `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages
  * `info`: contains useful information about progress
  * `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.

## Development#

During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.

### Implementation details#

n8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.

The initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.

Once the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.

Check the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.

### Adding logs#

Once the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.

Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.

In the example above, we use the standard log levels described above. The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.

    // You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier

    import {
    	LoggerProxy as Logger
    } from 'n8n-workflow';

    // Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties

    Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow "${workflow.name}"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});

---|---

When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:

  * Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
  * Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
  * Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.
  * Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.

## Front-end logs#

As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.

# integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/common-issues/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/common-issues.md "Edit this page")

# Telegram node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel#

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: `Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

  1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
  2. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
  3. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
  4. Search for the bot's username and select it.
  5. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

## Get the Chat ID#

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

  1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
  2. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
  3. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second#

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

  1. **Loop Over Items node** : Use the [Loop Over Items](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
  2. **Telegram node** : Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
  3. **Code node** : Connect the [Code](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages#

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](../message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

  1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
  2. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
  3. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](../message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.

# Mistral Cloud Chat Model node#

Use the Mistral Cloud Chat Model node to combine Mistral Cloud's chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Mistral Cloud Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mistral/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters#

  * **Model** : Select the model to use to generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads models from Mistral Cloud and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Node options#

  * **Maximum Number of Tokens** : Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
  * **Sampling Temperature** : Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
  * **Timeout** : Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.
  * **Max Retries** : Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.
  * **Top P** : Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.
  * **Enable Safe Mode** : Enable safe mode by injecting a safety prompt at the beginning of the completion. This helps prevent the model from generating offensive content.
  * **Random Seed** : Enter a seed to use for random sampling. If set, different calls will generate deterministic results.

# HubSpot credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [HubSpot](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/)
  * [HubSpot Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspottrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * App token: Use with the [HubSpot](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/) node.
  * Developer API key: Use with the [HubSpot Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspottrigger/) node.
  * OAuth2: Use with the [HubSpot](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/) node.

API key deprecated

HubSpot deprecated the regular **API Key** authentication method. The option still appears in n8n, but you should use the authentication methods listed above instead. If you have existing integrations using this API key method, refer to HubSpot's [Migrate an API key integration to a private app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/migrate-an-api-key-integration-to-a-private-app) guide and set up an app token.

## Related resources#

Refer to [HubSpot's API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) for more information about the service. The [HubSpot Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspottrigger/) node uses the Webhooks API; refer to [HubSpot's Webhooks API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/webhooks) for more information about that service.

## Using App token#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) account or [HubSpot developer](https://developers.hubspot.com/) account and:

  * An **App Token**

To generate an app token, create a private app in HubSpot:

  1. In your HubSpot account, select the **settings icon** in the main navigation bar.
  2. In the left sidebar menu, go to **Integrations > Private Apps**.
  3. Select **Create private app**.
  4. On the **Basic Info** tab, enter your app's **Name**.
  5. Hover over the **placeholder logo** and select the upload icon to upload a square image that will serve as the logo for your app.
  6. Enter a **Description** for your app.
  7. Open the **Scopes** tab and add the appropriate scopes. Refer to Required scopes for HubSpot node for a complete list of scopes you should add.
  8. Select **Create app** to finish the process.
  9. In the modal, review the info about your app's access token, then select **Continue creating**.
  10. Once your app's created, open the **Access token card** and select **Show token** to reveal the token.
  11. Copy this token and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [HubSpot Private Apps documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps) for more information.

## Using Developer API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a [HubSpot developer](https://developers.hubspot.com/) account and:

  * A **Client ID** : Generated once you create a public app.
  * A **Client Secret** : Generated once you create a public app.
  * A **Developer API Key** : Generated from your Developer Apps dashboard.
  * An **App ID** : Generated once you create a public app.

To create the public app and set up the credential:

  1. Log into your [HubSpot app developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/).
  2. Select **Apps** from the main navigation bar.
  3. Select **Get HubSpot API key**. You may need to select the option to **Show key**.
  4. Copy the key and enter it in n8n as the **Developer API Key**.
  5. Still on the HubSpot **Apps** page, select **Create app**.
  6. On the **App Info** tab, add an **App name** , **Description** , **Logo** , and any support contact info you want to provide. Anyone encountering the app would see these.
  7. Open the **Auth** tab.
  8. Copy the **App ID** and enter it in n8n.
  9. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in n8n.
  10. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in n8n.
  11. In the **Scopes** section, select **Add new scope**.
  12. Add all the scopes listed in Required scopes for HubSpot Trigger node to your app.
  13. Select **Update**.
  14. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it as the **Redirect URL** in your HubSpot app.
  15. Select **Create app** to finish creating the HubSpot app.

Refer to the [HubSpot Public Apps documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app) for more detailed instructions.

### Required scopes for HubSpot Trigger node#

If you're creating an app for use with the [HubSpot Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspottrigger/) node, n8n recommends starting with these scopes:

**Element** | **Object** | **Permission** | **Scope name**
---|---|---|---
n/a | n/a | n/a | `oauth`
CRM | Companies | Read | `crm.objects.companies.read`
CRM | Companies schemas | Read | `crm.schemas.companies.read`
CRM | Contacts | Read | `crm.objects.contacts.read`
CRM | Contacts schemas | Read | `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
CRM | Deals | Read | `crm.objects.deals.read`
CRM | Deals schemas | Read | `crm.schemas.deals.read`

HubSpot old accounts

Some HubSpot accounts don't have access to all the scopes. HubSpot is migrating accounts gradually. If you can't find all the scopes in your current HubSpot developer account, try creating a fresh developer account.

## Using OAuth2#

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a new public app:

  1. Log into your [HubSpot app developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/).
  2. Select **Apps** from the main navigation bar.
  3. Select **Create app**.
  4. On the **App Info** tab, add an **App name** , **Description** , **Logo** , and any support contact info you want to provide. Anyone encountering the app would see these.
  5. Open the **Auth** tab.
  6. Copy the **App ID** and enter it in n8n.
  7. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in n8n.
  8. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in n8n.
  9. In the **Scopes** section, select **Add new scope**.
  10. Add all the scopes listed in Required scopes for HubSpot node to your app.
  11. Select **Update**.
  12. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it as the **Redirect URL** in your HubSpot app.
  13. Select **Create app** to finish creating the HubSpot app.

Refer to the [HubSpot Public Apps documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app) for more detailed instructions. If you need more detail on what's happening in the OAuth web flow, refer to the [HubSpot Working with OAuth documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth).

## Required scopes for HubSpot node#

If you're creating an app for use with the [HubSpot](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/) node, n8n recommends starting with these scopes:

**Element** | **Object** | **Permission** | **Scope name(s)**
---|---|---|---
n/a | n/a | n/a | `oauth`
n/a | n/a | n/a | `forms`
n/a | n/a | n/a | `tickets`
CRM | Companies | Read
Write | `crm.objects.companies.read`
`crm.objects.companies.write`
CRM | Companies schemas | Read | `crm.schemas.companies.read`
CRM | Contacts schemas | Read | `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
CRM | Contacts | Read
Write | `crm.objects.contacts.read`
`crm.objects.contacts.write`
CRM | Deals | Read
Write | `crm.objects.deals.read`
`crm.objects.deals.write`

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md "Edit this page")

# Build a declarative-style node#

This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

## Prerequisites#

You need the following installed on your development machine:

  * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

  * JavaScript/TypeScript
  * REST APIs
  * git

## Build your node#

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.

Existing node

n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project#

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

  1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.
  2. Clone your new repository:

         1
         2

|

         git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics
         cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics

---|---

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

  * `nodes/ExampleNode`
  * `nodes/HTTPBin`
  * `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
  * `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/NasaPics`
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`
`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

    1

|

    npm i

---|---

### Step 2: Add an icon#

Save the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg) as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Create the node#

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](../reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports#

Start by adding the import statements:

    1

|

    import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

---|---

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class#

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8

|

    export class NasaPics implements INodeType {
    	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    		// Basic node details will go here
    		properties: [
    		// Resources and operations will go here
    		]
    	};
    }

---|---

#### Step 3.3: Add node details#

All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

    18
    19
    20
    21
    22
    23
    24
    25

    displayName: 'NASA Pics',
    name: 'NasaPics',
    icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
    group: ['transform'],
    version: 1,
    subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',
    description: 'Get data from NASAs API',
    defaults: {
    	name: 'NASA Pics',
    },
    inputs: ['main'],
    outputs: ['main'],
    credentials: [
    	{
    		name: 'NasaPicsApi',
    		required: true,
    	},
    ],
    requestDefaults: {
    	baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
    	headers: {
    		Accept: 'application/json',
    		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    	},
    },

---|---

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

#### Step 3.4: Add resources#

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17
    18
    19
    20
    21

|

    properties: [
    	{
    		displayName: 'Resource',
    		name: 'resource',
    		type: 'options',
    		noDataExpression: true,
    		options: [
    			{
    				name: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day',
    				value: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
    			},
    			{
    				name: 'Mars Rover Photos',
    				value: 'marsRoverPhotos',
    			},
    		],
    		default: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
    	},
    	// Operations will go here

    ]

---|---

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations#

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

      1
      2
      3
      4
      5
      6

    	},
    	routing: {
    		request: {
    			// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
    			qs: {
    				earth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
    			},
    		},
    	},
    },
    // Optional/additional fields will go here

---|---

This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.

#### Step 3.6: Optional fields#

Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

    {
    	displayName: 'Additional Fields',
    	name: 'additionalFields',
    	type: 'collection',
    	default: {},
    	placeholder: 'Add Field',
    	displayOptions: {
    		show: {
    			resource: [
    				'astronomyPictureOfTheDay',
    			],
    			operation: [
    				'get',
    			],
    		},
    	},
    	options: [
    		{
    			displayName: 'Date',
    			name: 'apodDate',
    			type: 'dateTime',
    			default: '',
    			routing: {
    				request: {
    					// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string
    					qs: {
    						date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}',
    					},
    				},
    			},
    		},
    	],
    }

---|---

### Step 4: Set up authentication#

The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](../reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 5: Add node metadata#

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8

    {
    	"node": "n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics",
    	"nodeVersion": "1.0",
    	"codexVersion": "1.0",
    	"categories": [
    		"Miscellaneous"
    	],

    			}
    		]
    	}
    }

---|---

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](../reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 6: Update the npm package details#

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

---|---

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Test your node#

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

  1. Install n8n using npm:

         1

|

         npm install n8n -g

---|---

  2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # In your node directory
         npm run build
         npm link

---|---

  3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

         1
         2
         3

|

         # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
         # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
         npm link <node-package-name>

---|---

Check your directory

Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

     * `~/.n8n/custom/`
     * `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

  4. Start n8n:

         1

|

         n8n start

---|---

  5. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

Node names

Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

### Troubleshooting#

  * There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.

You have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`

    1
    2
    3
    4

|

    # In ~/.n8n directory run
    mkdir custom
    cd custom
    npm init

---|---

## Next steps#

  * [Deploy your node](../../deploy/).
  * View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo). Note that the main node is declarative, while the trigger node is in programmatic style.
  * Learn about [node versioning](../reference/node-versioning/).

# Role-based access control (RBAC)#

Feature availability

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](projects/).

RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.

# Simple Vector Store node#

Use the Simple Vector Store node to store and retrieve [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) in n8n's in-app memory.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Simple Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

This node is different from AI memory nodes

The simple vector storage described here is different to the AI memory nodes such as [Simple Memory](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/).

This node creates a [vector database](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) in the app memory.

## Data safety limitations#

Before using the Simple Vector Store node, it's important to understand its limitations and how it works.

Warning

n8n recommends using Simple Vector store for development use only.

### Vector store data isn't persistent#

This node stores data in memory only. All data is lost when n8n restarts and may also be purged in low-memory conditions.

### All instance users can access vector store data#

Memory keys for the Simple Vector Store node are global, not scoped to individual workflows.

This means that all users of the instance can access vector store data by adding a Simple Vector Store node and selecting the memory key, regardless of the access controls set for the original workflow. Take care not to expose sensitive information when ingesting data with the Simple Vector Store node.

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the Simple Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents#

You can use the Simple Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Simple Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of in step 2 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the Simple Vector Store node directly to the [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Simple Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Simple Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Simple Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Simple Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Simple Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

## Memory Management#

The Simple Vector Store implements memory management to prevent excessive memory usage:

  * Automatically cleans up old vector stores when memory pressure increases
  * Removes inactive stores that haven't been accessed for a configurable amount of time

### Configuration Options#

You can control memory usage with these environment variables:

Variable | Type | Default | Description
---|---|---|---
`N8N_VECTOR_STORE_MAX_MEMORY` | Number | -1 | Maximum memory in MB allowed for all vector stores combined (-1 to disable limits).
`N8N_VECTOR_STORE_TTL_HOURS` | Number | -1 | Hours of inactivity after which a store gets removed (-1 to disable TTL).

On n8n Cloud, these values are preset to 100MB (about 8,000 documents, depending on document size and metadata) and 7 days respectively. For self-hosted instances, both values default to -1(no memory limits or time-based cleanup).

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Memory Key** : Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.
  * **Prompt** : Enter the search query.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Memory Key** : Select or create the key you want to store the vector memory as.
  * **Clear Store** : Use this parameter to control whether to wipe the vector store for the given memory key for this workflow before inserting data (turned on).

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters#

  * **Memory Key** : Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Memory Key** : Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

# Sticky Notes#

Sticky Notes allow you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

n8n recommends using Sticky Notes heavily, especially on [template workflows](../../../glossary/#template-n8n), to help other users understand your workflow.

![Screenshot of a basic workflow with an example sticky note](../../../_images/workflows/components/stickies/example-sticky-note.png)

## Create a Sticky Note#

Sticky Notes are a core node. To add a new Sticky Note:

  1. Open the nodes panel.
  2. Search for `note`.
  3. Click the **Sticky Note** node. n8n adds a new Sticky Note to the canvas.

## Edit a Sticky Note#

  1. Double click the Sticky Note you want to edit.
  2. Write your note. [This guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) explains how to format your text with Markdown. n8n uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), which implements the CommonMark specification.
  3. Click away from the note, or press `Esc`, to stop editing.

## Change the color#

To change the Sticky Note color:

  1. Hover over the Sticky Note
  2. Select **Change color** ![Change Sticky Note color icon](../../../_images/common-icons/change-color.png)

## Sticky Note positioning#

You can:

  * Drag a Sticky Note anywhere on the canvas.
  * Drag Sticky Notes behind nodes. You can use this to visually group nodes.
  * Resize Sticky Notes by hovering over the edge of the note and dragging to resize.
  * Change the color: select **Options** ![Options icon](../../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) to open the color selector.

## Writing in Markdown#

Sticky Notes support Markdown formatting. This section describes some common options.

    ## This is a sub-heading
    ### This is a smaller sub-heading

    You can add links:
    [Example](https://example.com/)

    Create lists with asterisks:

    * Item one
    * Item two

    Or created ordered lists with numbers:

    1. Item one
    2. Item two

# code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/index.md "Edit this page")

# Data transformation functions#

Data transformation functions are helper functions to make data transformation easier in [expressions](../../../glossary/#expression-n8n).

JavaScript in expressions

You can use any JavaScript in expressions. Refer to [Expressions](../../expressions/) for more information.

For a list of available functions, refer to the page for your data type:

  * [Arrays](arrays/)
  * [Dates](dates/)
  * [Numbers](numbers/)
  * [Objects](objects/)
  * [Strings](strings/)

## Usage#

Data transformation functions are available in the expressions editor.

The syntax is:

    1

|

    {{ dataItem.function() }}

---|---

For example, to check if a string is an email:

    1
    2
    3

|

    {{ "example@example.com".isEmail() }}

    // Returns true

# advanced-ai/examples/understand-chains/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/examples/understand-chains.md "Edit this page")

# What's a chain in AI?#

[Chains](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) bring together different components of AI to create a cohesive system. They set up a sequence of calls between the components. These components can include models and [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).

## Chains in n8n#

n8n provides three chain nodes:

  * [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.
  * [Question and Answer Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a [vector store](../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.
  * [Summarization Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.

There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app.

# user-management/best-practices/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/best-practices.md "Edit this page")

# Best practices for user management#

This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.

## All platforms#

  * n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
  * Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
  * To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
  * Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
    * The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.
    * Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

## Self-hosted#

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:

  * `N8N_HOST`
  * `N8N_PORT`
  * `N8N_PROTOCOL`
  * `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`

More information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).

# integrations/builtin/credentials/actionnetwork/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/credentials/actionnetwork.md "Edit this page")

# Action Network credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Action Network](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.actionnetwork/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key

## Related resources#

Refer to [Action Network's API documentation](https://actionnetwork.org/docs/) for more information about working with the service.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need an [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org/) account with API key access enabled and:

  * An **API Key**

To get an API key:

  1. Log in to your Action Network account.
  2. From the **Start Organizing** menu, select **Details >** [**API & Sync**](https://actionnetwork.org/apis).
  3. Select the list you want to generate an API key for.
  4. Generate an API key for that list.
  5. Copy the **API Key** and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to the [Action Network API Authentication instructions](https://actionnetwork.org/docs/v2/#auth) for more information.

## Request API access#

Each user account and group on the Action Network has a separate API key to access that user or group's data.

You must explicitly request API access from Action Network, which you can do in one of two ways:

  1. If you're already a paying customer, [contact them](https://actionnetwork.org/contact) to request partner access. Partner access includes API key access.
  2. If you're a developer, [request a developer account](https://actionnetwork.org/developers). Once your account request is granted, you'll have API key access.

# user-management/saml/setup/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/user-management/saml/setup.md "Edit this page")

# Set up SAML#

Feature availability

  * Available on Enterprise plans.
  * You need access to the n8n instance owner account to enable and configure SAML

Available from version 0.225.0.

This page tells you how to enable SAML SSO (single sign-on) in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with SAML. If you're not, [SAML Explained in Plain English](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml) can help you understand how SAML works, and its benefits.

## Enable SAML#

  1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **SSO**.
  2. Make a note of the n8n **Redirect URL** and **Entity ID**.
     1. **Optional** : if your IdP allows you to set up SAML from imported metadata, navigate to the **Entity ID** URL and save the XML.
     2. **Optional** : if you are running n8n behind a load balancer make sure you have `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` configured.
  3. Set up SAML with your IdP (identity provider). You need the redirect URL and entity ID. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.
  4. After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:
     1. **Metadata URL** : Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the **Identity Provider Settings** field in n8n.
     2. **Raw XML** : Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle **Identiy Provider Settings** to **XML** , then copy the raw XML into **Identity Provider Settings**.
  5. Select **Save settings**.
  6. Select **Test settings** to check your SAML setup is working.
  7. Set SAML 2.0 to **Activated**.

SAML Request Type

Please note, n8n currently doesn't support `POST` binding. Please configure your IdP to use `HTTP` request binding instead.

## Generic IdP setup#

The steps to configure the IdP vary depending on your chosen IdP. These are some common setup tasks:

  * Create an app for n8n in your IdP.
  * Map n8n attributes to IdP attributes:

Name | Name format | Value (IdP side)
---|---|---
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` | URI Reference | User email
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/firstname` | URI Reference | User First Name
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/lastname` | URI Reference | User Last Name
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn` | URI Reference | User Email

# Airtable node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Airtable node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials#

This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this:

    1

|

    There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"

---|---

The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.

Refer to the [Airtable credentials](../../../credentials/airtable/) and [Airtables scopes documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) for more information.

## Service is receiving too many requests from you#

Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.

If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.

You can find out more in the [Airtable's rate limits documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits). If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the [handling rate limits](../../../rate-limits/) page.

# MySQL node#

Use the MySQL node to automate work in MySQL, and integrate MySQL with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of MySQL features, including executing an SQL query, as well as inserting, and updating rows in a database.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the MySQL node supports and links to more resources.

Credentials

Refer to [MySQL credentials](../../credentials/mysql/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Operations#

  * Delete
  * Execute SQL
  * Insert
  * Insert or Update

## Related resources#

Refer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html) for more information about the service.

Refer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html) for more information on writing SQL queries.

## Use query parameters#

When creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12

|

    [
        {
            "email": "alex@example.com",
            "name": "Alex",
            "age": 21
        },
        {
            "email": "jamie@example.com",
            "name": "Jamie",
            "age": 33
        }
    ]

---|---

You can write a query like:

    1

|

    SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;

---|---

Then in **Query Parameters** , provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

    1
    2

|

    // users is an example table name
    users, {{ $json.email }}

  6. Select **Create app**.
  7. This should open the **Products** tab. Select the products/APIs you want to enable for your app. For the LinkedIn node to work properly, you must include:
     * **Share on LinkedIn**
     * **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**
  8. Once you've requested access to the products you need, open the **Auth** tab.
  9. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  10. Select the icon to **Copy** the **Primary Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **Client Secret**.

Posting from organization accounts

To post as an organization, you need to put your app through LinkedIn's [Community Management App Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review) process.

Refer to [Getting Access to LinkedIn APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/getting-access) for more information on scopes and permissions.

## Using OAuth2#

Only use this method for older LinkedIn apps and user accounts.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

All users must select:

  * **Organization Support** : If turned on, the credential requests permission to post as an organization using the `w_organization_social` scope.
    * To use this option, you must put your app through LinkedIn's [Community Management App Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review) process.
  * **Legacy** : If turned on, the credential uses legacy scopes for `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress` instead of the newer `profile` and `email` scopes.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a new developer app:

  1. Log into LinkedIn and select this link to [create a new developer app](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new).
  2. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
  3. For the **LinkedIn Page** , enter a LinkedIn [Company Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852) or use the **Create a new LinkedIn Page** link to create one on-the-fly. Refer to [Associate an App with a LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a548360) for more information.
  4. Add an **App logo**.
  5. Check the box to agree to the **Legal agreement**.
  6. Select **Create app**.
  7. This should open the **Products** tab. Select the products/APIs you want to enable for your app. For the LinkedIn node to work properly, you must include:
     * **Share on LinkedIn**
     * **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**
  8. Once you've requested access to the products you need, open the **Auth** tab.
  9. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
  10. Select the icon to **Copy** the **Primary Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **Client Secret**.

Posting from organization accounts

To post as an organization, you need to put your app through LinkedIn's [Community Management App Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review) process.

Refer to [Getting Access to LinkedIn APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/getting-access) for more information on scopes and permissions.

# integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/paired-items/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/paired-items.md "Edit this page")

# Item linking#

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](../../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17
    18
    19
    20

|

    // Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
    newItem = {
    	"json": { . . . },
    	"pairedItem": {
    		"item": item.pairedItem,
    		// Optional: choose the input to use
    		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
    		"input": 0
    };

    // Or set the index manually
    newItem = {
    		"json": { . . . }
    		"pairedItem": {
    			"item": i,
    			// Optional: choose the input to use
    			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
    			"input": 0
    		},
    };

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorezep.md "Edit this page")

# Zep Vector Store node#

Use the Zep Vector Store to interact with Zep vector databases. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Zep Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/zep/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Zep Vector Store integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/zep-vector-store/) page.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns#

You can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents#

You can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool#

You can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents#

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions#

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store.

## Node parameters#

### Operation Mode#

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many** , **Insert Documents** , **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)** , and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

#### Get Many#

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents#

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)#

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Rerank Results#

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Insert Documents parameters#

  * **Collection Name** : Enter the collection name to store the data in.

### Get Many parameters#

  * **Collection Name** : Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
  * **Prompt** : Enter the search query.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters#

  * **Collection Name** : Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters#

  * **Name** : The name of the vector store.
  * **Description** : Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
  * **Collection Name** : Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
  * **Limit** : Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Node options#

### Embedding Dimensions#

Must be the same when embedding the data and when querying it.

This sets the size of the array of floats used to represent the semantic meaning of a text document.

Read more about Zep embeddings in [Zep's embeddings documentation](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/embeddings/).

### Is Auto Embedded#

Available in the **Insert Documents** Operation Mode, enabled by default.

Disable this to configure your embeddings in Zep instead of in n8n.

### Metadata Filter#

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

# integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design.md "Edit this page")

# Design your node's user interface#

Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.

This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.

## Design guidance#

All node's use n8n's [node UI elements](../../build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:

  * Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
    * What can you leave out?
    * What can you simplify?
    * Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
  * Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on showing and hiding fields.

## Standards#

### UI text style#

Element | Style
---|---
Drop-down value | Title case
Hint | Sentence case
Info box | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.
Node name | Title case
Parameter name | Title case
Subtitle | Title case
Tooltip | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.

### UI text terminology#

  * Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on name and description for upsert operations).
  * Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
  * Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
  * Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it.

### Node naming conventions#

Convention | Correct | Incorrect
---|---|---
If a node is a trigger node,
the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end,
with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger
Don't include 'node' in the name. | Asana | Asana Node, Asana node

### Showing and hiding fields#

Fields can either be:

  * Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
  * Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.

Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.

### Conventions by field type#

#### Credentials#

n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.

#### Resources and operations#

APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.

When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource** , and your second field should be **Operation**.

#### Required fields#

Order fields by:

  * Most important to least important.
  * Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document** , **Page** , and **Text to insert** , put them in that order.

#### Optional fields#

  * Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.
  * If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.
  * Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
  * If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.

#### Help#

There are five types of help built in to the GUI:

  * Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](../../build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.
  * Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
  * Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
  * Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](../../build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.
  * Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon !["Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle"](../../../../_images/common-icons/help-tooltip.png). Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
  * You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.
  * When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
  * Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.

Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.

#### Errors#

Make it clear which fields are required.

Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.

When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.

#### Toggles#

  * Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . .**.
  * You may need a list rather than a toggle:
    * Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
    * Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).

#### Lists#

  * Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
  * Sort list options alphabetically.
  * You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
  * If there is an option like **All** , use the word **All** , not shorthand like *****.

#### Trigger node inputs#

When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:

  * Name the parameter **Trigger on**.
  * Don't include a tooltip.

#### Subtitles#

Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:

    1

|

    subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',

---|---

#### IDs#

When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.

  * Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
    * By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](../../build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information.
    * By entering an ID.
  * Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's [Expressions](../../../../code/expressions/) documentation.
  * Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
    * If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
    * If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.

#### Dates and timestamps#

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

#### JSON#

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

  * Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
  * Using an expression that returns JSON.

#### Node icons#

### Common patterns and exceptions#

This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.

#### Simplify responses#

APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:

  * Name: **Simplify Response**
  * Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**

#### Upsert operations#

This should always be a separate operation with:

  * Name: **Create or Update**
  * Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**

#### Boolean operators#

n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.

For example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All** , as separate options.

#### Source keys or binary properties#

Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**.

# npm#

npm is a quick way to get started with n8n on your local machine. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. n8n requires Node.js 18 or above.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.99.1
Current `next`: 1.100.0

## Try n8n with npx#

You can try n8n without installing it using npx.

From the terminal, run:

    1

|

    npx n8n

---|---

This command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening <http://localhost:5678>.

## Install globally with npm#

To install n8n globally, use npm:

    1

|

    npm install n8n -g

---|---

To install or update to a specific version of n8n use the `@` syntax to specify the version. For example:

    1

|

    npm install -g n8n@0.126.1

---|---

To install `next`:

    1

|

    npm install -g n8n@next

---|---

After the installation, start n8n by running:

    1
    2
    3

|

    n8n
    # or
    n8n start

---|---

### Next steps#

Try out n8n using the [Quickstarts](../../../try-it-out/).

## Updating#

To update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:

    1

|

    npm update -g n8n

---|---

To install the `next` version:

    1

|

    npm install -g n8n@next

---|---

## n8n with tunnel#

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:

    1

|

    n8n start --tunnel

---|---

## Reverting an upgrade#

Install the older version that you want to go back to.

If the upgrade involved a database migration:

  1. Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
  2. Run `n8n db:revert` on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.

## Windows troubleshooting#

If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

# Facebook Trigger Group object#

Use this object to receive updates about activities and events in a group. Refer to [Facebook Trigger](../) for more information on the trigger itself.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

## Trigger configuration#

To configure the trigger with this Object:

  1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
  2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
  3. Select **Group** as the **Object**.
  4. **Field Names or IDs** : By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in.
  5. In **Options** , turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.

# privacy-security/privacy/index.md

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/privacy-security/privacy.md "Edit this page")

# Privacy#

This page describes n8n's data privacy practices.

## GDPR#

### Data processing agreement#

For Cloud versions of n8n, n8n is considered both a Controller and a Processor as defined by the GDPR. As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Processing Agreement](https://n8n.io/legal/#data) as part of the company's standard [Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms).

The n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en). These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.

You can find a list of n8n sub-processors [here](https://n8n.io/legal/#subprocessors).

Self-hosted n8n

For self-hosted versions, n8n is neither a Controller nor a Processor, as we don't manage your data

### Submitting a GDPR deletion request#

Email privacy@n8n.io to request data deletion.

### Sub-processors#

This is a list of sub-processors authorized to process customer data for n8n's service. n8n audits each sub-processor's security controls and applicable regulations for the protection of personal data.

Sub-processor name | Contact details | Geographic location of processing
---|---|---
Microsoft Azure | Microsoft Azure
1 Microsoft Way
Redmond
WA 98052
USA
Contact information: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement#mainhowtocontactusmodule | Germany (West Central Region)
Hetzner Online | Hetzner Online GmbH
Industriestr. 25
91710 Gunzenhausen
Germany
data-protection@hetzner.com | Germany

Subscribe [here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/FdeRxSkH?typeform-source=n8n.io) to receive updates when n8n adds or changes a sub-processor.

### GDPR for self-hosted users#

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

## Data collection#

n8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy).

The data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.

### Data collection in self-hosted n8n#

n8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data.

#### What n8n collects#

  * Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)
  * Error reports for app crashes and API issues
  * The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)
  * From node parameters:
    * The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)
    * For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)
  * Data around workflow executions:
    * Status
    * The user ID of the user who ran the execution
    * The first time a workflow loads data from an external source
    * The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution
  * The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).
  * Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)
  * Diagnostic information:
    * n8n version
    * Selected settings:
      * DB_TYPE
      * N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED
      * N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS
      * [Execution variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions/)
    * OS, RAM, and CPUs
    * Anonymous instance ID
  * IP address

#### What n8n doesn't collect#

n8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:

  * Personally identifiable information (except IP address)
  * Credential information
  * Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')
  * Execution data
  * Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)
  * Error payloads

#### How collection works#

Most data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).

#### Opting out of telemetry#

Telemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.

To opt out of telemetry events:

    1

|

    export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false

---|---

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:

    1

|

    export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false

---|---

To disable the templates feature (prevents background health check calls):

    1

|

    export N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false

---|---

See [configuration](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.

### Data collection in n8n Cloud#

n8n Cloud collects everything listed in Data collection in self-hosted n8n.

Additionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.

### AI in n8n#

To provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).

#### How n8n uses AI#

To assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.

#### When n8n shares data#

Data is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.

#### What n8n shares#

  * **General Workflow Information** : This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.
  * **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.
  * **Node Configuration** : This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.
  * **Code and Expressions** : This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.

#### What n8n doesn't share#

  * **Credentials** : Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.
  * **Output Data** : The actual data processed by your workflows.
  * **Sensitive Information** : Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

### Documentation telemetry#

n8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better.

Change cookie settings

## Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data#

PID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.

### n8n Cloud#

#### PID retention#

n8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service.

For n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account.

n8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.

#### PID deletion#

If you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.

### Self-hosted#

Self-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](../what-you-can-do/) for more information.

## Payment processor#

n8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method.

[ ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/declarative-style-parameters.md "Edit this page")

# Declarative-style parameters#

These are the parameters available for [node base file](../) of declarative-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](../../../declarative-style-node/).

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`#

_Object_ | _Optional_

`methods` contains the `loadOptions` object. You can use `loadOptions` to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

     1
     2
     3
     4
     5

    methods : {
    	loadOptions: {
    		routing: {
    			request: {
    				url: '/webhook/example-option-parameters',
    				method: 'GET',
    			},
    			output: {
    				postReceive: [
    					{
    						// When the returned data is nested under another property
    						// Specify that property key
    						type: 'rootProperty',
    						properties: {
    							property: 'responseData',
    						},
    					},
    					{
    						type: 'setKeyValue',
    						properties: {
    							name: '={{$responseItem.key}} ({{$responseItem.value}})',
    							value: '={{$responseItem.value}}',
    						},
    					},
    					{
    						// If incoming data is an array of objects, sort alphabetically by key
    						type: 'sort',
    						properties: {
    							key: 'name',
    						},
    					},
    				],
    			},
    		},
    	}
    },

---|---

## `routing`#

_Object_ | _Required_

`routing` is an object used within an `options` array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.

The code example below comes from the [Declarative-style tutorial](../../../declarative-style-node/). It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use `requestDefaults` to set up the basic API call details, and `routing` to add information for each operation.

                    url: '/planetary/apod'
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
    }

---|---

## `version`#

_Number_ or _Array_ | _Optional_

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

  4. Add a Split Out node to the canvas and connect it to the Code node.
  5. In the Split Out node, enter `data` in the **Fields To Split Out** field.

## Removing duplicates from the current input#

  1. Add a Remove Duplicates node to the canvas and connect it to the Split Out node. Choose **Remove items repeated within current input** as the **Action** to start.
  2. Open the Remove Duplicates node and ensure that the **Operation** is set to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**.
  3. Choose **All fields** in the **Compare** field.
  4. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items that have the same data across all fields. Your output in table view should look like this:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
1 | Taylor Swift | Pop star | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z
2 | Ed Sheeran | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z
3 | Adele | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z
4 | Bruno Mars | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z
5 | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z
6 | Katy Perry | Pop star | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z
7 | Lady Gaga | Pop star | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z
8 | Rihanna | Pop star | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z

  5. Open the Remove Duplicates node again and change the **Compare** parameter to **Selected Fields**.
  6. In the **Fields To Compare** field, enter `job`.
  7. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items in the current input that have the same `job` data. Your output in table view should look like this:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
1 | Taylor Swift | Pop star | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z
2 | Ed Sheeran | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z

## Keep items where the value is new#

  1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
  2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is New**.
  3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.name }}`.
  4. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
1 | Taylor Swift | Pop star | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z
1 | Taylor Swift | Pop star | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z

8 | Rihanna | Pop star | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z

Items are only compared against previous executions

The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input _and_ across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the **Remove Items Repated Within Current Input** operation and the second to use the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation.

  5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
  6. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains the one new record from the Code node:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
9 | Tom Hanks | Actor | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z

The **Discarded** tab contains the items processed by the previous execution:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---

8 | Rihanna | Pop star | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

  7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
  8. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is higher than any previous value#

  1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
  2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**.
  3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.id }}`.
  4. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---

9 | Tom Hanks | Actor | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z

  5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Madonna" and "Bob Dylan."
  6. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Bob Dylan." n8n keeps this item because its `id` column value (15) is higher than any previous values (the previous maximum value was 9):

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
15 | Bob Dylan | Folk singer | 2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z

The **Discarded** tab contains the 13 items with an `id` column value equal to or less than the previous maximum value (9). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Madonna" because its `id` value isn't larger than the previous maximum value:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
0 | Madonna | Pop star | 2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

  7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
  8. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is a date later than any previous date#

  1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
  2. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**.
  3. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.last_updated }}`.
  4. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

  5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Harry Nilsson" and "Kylie Minogue."

  6. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Kylie Minogue." n8n keeps this item because its `last_updated` column value (`2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z`) is later than any previous values (the previous latest date was `2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`):

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
11 | Kylie Minogue | Pop star | 2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z

The **Discarded** tab contains the 15 items with a `last_updated` column value equal to or earlier than the previous latest date (`2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Harry Nilsson" because its `last_updated` value isn't later than the previous maximum value:

**id** | **name** | **job** | **last_updated**
---|---|---|---
10 | Harry Nilsson | Singer-songwriter | 2020-10-17T17:11:38.493Z

# n8n community node blocklist#

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

  * The node is intentionally malicious
  * It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)

If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact [hello@n8n.io](mailto: hello@n8n.io).
